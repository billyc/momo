# The Modeling Mobility Conference: _Advancing Data, Approaches, and Community for Transportation Planning_

The Modeling Mobility Conference continues the legacy of previous notable transportation planning and modeling events, now serving as the premier forum for professionals working with travel models, transportation data, and quantitative analysis. This conference emphasizes advancing analytical support for real-world transportation decisions and fostering a strong community through interactive workshops, sessions, and networking opportunities. Join us every two years where we welcome practitioners, researchers, students, and all involved in developing, analyzing, and applying transportation data and tools to connect, learn, share, and build lasting professional relationships.

The MoMo conference is organized by an ALL-volunteer group of transportation professionals from various sectors, including the public sector, private consulting, vendors, and academia.

Because a group of volunteers cannot sign contracts, book conference spaces and hotel blocks, or put up the funds to support a website and abstract submission site, the [Zephyr Foundation](https://zephyrfoundation.org/), a 501(c)3 non-profit, acts as the sponsoring organization.

## Past Conferences: 2025

The 2025 MoMo Theme is **CONNECT!**

MoMo25: Connect! celebrates the power of connection in transportation—linking people, goods, and ideas. As professionals, students, mentors, colleagues, and friends, we come together to share insights, learn from each other, and strengthen our collective practice. Together, we’ll explore how transportation can both empower and challenge communities, and work toward solutions that support meaningful connections for all.

Upon learning in the mid-COVID years that TRB would no longer commit to sponsoring specific conferences in the future, a few ‘previous conference volunteers’ were concerned that these conferences might not exist moving forward. They sought to work with TRB to try to find an arrangement that might fit within TRB’s re-organization and objectives but were unable to reach a consensus. It appeared to them that the best way forward was to find another organization that would be willing to take on the financial and legal obligations for a conference – a sponsorship role that had previously been filled by TRB – and who could commit to a regular conference cycle.

They were looking specifically for non-profit, transportation-specific organizations, and Zephyr expressed interest in taking on the Sponsor role. Since committing to sponsoring the MoMo conference, the Zephyr Board of Directors has taken a hands-off approach, including not explicitly influencing design of the conference themes, program, or soliciting volunteers for the planning committee – these tasks have been driven primarily by the all-volunteer Conference Planning Committee.

The vision is that moving forward, the Modeling Mobility Conference will be seen as a vital _complement_ to other transportation-related conferences put on by TRB and other organizations.
