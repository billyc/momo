## The Modeling Mobility Conference: _Advancing Data, Approaches, and Community for Transportation Planning_

The Modeling Mobility Conference continues the legacy of previous notable transportation planning and modeling events, now serving as the premier forum for professionals working with travel models, transportation data, and quantitative analysis. This conference emphasizes advancing analytical support for real-world transportation decisions and fostering a strong community through interactive workshops, sessions, and networking opportunities. Join us every two years where we welcome practitioners, researchers, students, and all involved in developing, analyzing, and applying transportation data and tools to connect, learn, share, and build lasting professional relationships.

The MoMo conference is organized by an ALL-volunteer group of transportation professionals from various sectors, including the public sector, private consulting, vendors, and academia.

Because a group of volunteers cannot sign contracts, book conference spaces and hotel blocks, or put up the funds to support a website and abstract submission site, the [Zephyr Foundation](https://zephyrfoundation.org/), a 501(c)3 non-profit, acts as the sponsoring organization.

## Past Conferences: 2025

The 2025 MoMo Theme is **CONNECT!**

MoMo25: Connect! celebrates the power of connection in transportation—linking people, goods, and ideas. As professionals, students, mentors, colleagues, and friends, we come together to share insights, learn from each other, and strengthen our collective practice. Together, we’ll explore how transportation can both empower and challenge communities, and work toward solutions that support meaningful connections for all.
