Bio: "Kazi E. Ullah is a Senior Associates in Travel Demand Forecasting business line\
  \ of Cambridge Systematics Inc.  He has experience in the areas of transportation\
  \ planning, travel demand modeling, forecasting and simulation, and several modeling\
  \ software packages, including Cube/Voyager, TransCAD, EMME, Tranplan and VISUM.\
  \  He also has experience in transit planning, freight modeling, air quality analysis\
  \ and integration between traffic and simulation models.Mr. Ullah was involved for\
  \ developing different scenarios for I-95 corridor study using South East Florida\
  \ Regional Planning Model (SERPM).  This is an activity based model with Cube and\
  \ Java platform.  Study includes interim and future year modeling with different\
  \ capacities in I-95 and I-75 corridor.  Mr. Ullah was also involved in developing\
  \ an Air Quality Post Processor tool for Florida DOT using Cube/Voyager to calculate\
  \ emissions that includes Oxides of Nitrogen (NOx), Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC),\
  \ and Carbon Dioxide Equivalents (CO2eq).For the Abu Dhabi Department of Transport\
  \ (DOT), Cambridge Systematics, as part of a team, provided support for the Transit\
  \ Corridor and City Centre Studies, and lead the Border Crossing Operations Study.\
  \  Mr. Ullah was responsible for running DoT\u2019s STEAM Model using Cube/Voyager.\
  \ Several alternatives were run before developing the best possible scenario for\
  \ micro-simulation studies in Al Ain area.Mr. Ullah was a key member of Chicago\
  \ BRT Planning Study. He was involved for evaluating the base year transit model\
  \ using EMME.  He was responsible for validation of base year 2015 transit ridership\
  \ in terms of on-board survey, and creating a future year ridership forecast. For\
  \ Chicago O\u2019hare Airport Traffic Study, Mr. Ullah was involved in running a\
  \ subarea model in EMME and validating the subarea with recent counts. He was responsible\
  \ to provide an interface between EMME and simulation model which is Vissim.For\
  \ the North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority (NJTPA), Mr. Ullah has developed\
  \ freight forecasting tools for Portway Extension Project using latest FAF network\
  \ and TRANSEARCH Data. He was responsible for developing base year and future-year\
  \ freight model using Cube/TP+ software.Mr. Ullah was involved with the integration\
  \ and update of all 19 county travel demand models into one software platform. Cube/Voyager\
  \ was used as a common platform so that all different municipal planning organizations\
  \ (MPOs) can use the same software for traffic forecasting. The Statewide network\
  \ merges the nine existing MPO and regional model networks and ten new district\
  \ networks to create single statewide model network. Socio-economic data for all\
  \ 19 counties was integrated into the model such that the model can run seamlessly.Mr.\
  \ Ullah received a Master of Science degree in Civil Engineering from Utah State\
  \ University."
