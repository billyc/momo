Bio: My name is Suzie Swim, I love learning about people and places and how we move
  around throughout our cities and throughout the world. I am fascinated by the world
  of transportation and began my time with the Wasatch Front Regional Council in the
  Geographic Information Science realm. Over time I have been given responsibilities
  in the Travel Demand Modeling realm and have really enjoyed the growth and challenges
  I have faced as I have tried to bring those two worlds together in my work. I have
  been with the Wasatch Front Regional Council for nearly 20 years and in that time
  I have seen transportation and technology evolve in so many ways and I have also
  seen how some things remain the same for good and for bad. I am excited about this
  Modeling Mobility Conference and the opportunity it provides for me to interact
  with many of you and to discuss the successes and challenges you too have faced
  in your careers in the modeling mobility world!
