Bio: "Hao Pang is an Associate Research Scientist at the Texas A&M Transportation\
  \ Institute (TTI) with over 10 years of experience in travel demand forecasting,\
  \ model development, and data visualization. He holds a Ph.D. in Community and Regional\
  \ Planning (transportation focus) from the University of Texas at Austin. Hao has\
  \ contributed to major enhancements of TexPACK, the integrated travel demand model\
  \ used by most MPOs in Texas. What\u2019s more, his work bridges the gap between\
  \ technical analysis and practical communication by designing and developing intuitive,\
  \ interactive tools that translate complex transportation model outputs into accessible,\
  \ meaningful insights for a wide range of users.Hao has led and contributed to the\
  \ development of several innovative, HTML-based reporting and analysis applications\
  \ and platforms built with open-source technologies such as JavaScript, Python,\
  \ and JSON. These tools feature dynamic tables, charts, and geospatial maps that\
  \ are interactive, visually engaging, and easy to interpret. Importantly, they are\
  \ designed to be fully stand-alone and browser-based, enabling state Departments\
  \ of Transportation (DOTs), Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs), local planners,\
  \ and the general public to explore sophisticated modeling results without needing\
  \ to install or learn specialized transportation software.His visualization tools\
  \ have been applied in real-world projects and presented at national and international\
  \ transportation conferences, where they\u2019ve been recognized for enhancing transparency,\
  \ improving stakeholder communication, and supporting informed decision-making in\
  \ transportation planning. Hao\u2019s work not only advances the usability of modeling\
  \ results but also promotes broader engagement with data through accessible, user-friendly\
  \ platforms."
