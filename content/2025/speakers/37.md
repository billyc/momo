Bio: I am a data analyst with strong expertise in data engineering, statistical modeling,
  and machine learning to support evidence-based decision-making. Currently, I am
  pursuing a Ph.D. in Transportation Engineering at Penn State, with an expected defense
  in October 2025. In my current role, I manage large-scale surveys, build scalable
  databases, and leverage statistical modeling and machine learning to evaluate public
  policies and programs. My former jobs at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and
  the University of Costa Rica also broadened my expertise in geospatial analysis
  and micro and macro simulation. I am dedicated to delivering innovative, data-driven
  insights that drive strategic improvements in complex systems.
