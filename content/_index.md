## About MoMo

The Modeling Mobility Conference continues the legacy of previous notable transportation planning and modeling events, now serving as the premier forum for professionals working with travel models, transportation data, and quantitative analysis. This conference emphasizes advancing analytical support for real-world transportation decisions and fostering a strong community through interactive workshops, sessions, and networking opportunities.

Join us on September 14-17, 2025, in Minneapolis, Minnesota at the beautiful McNamara Alumni Center on the University of Minnesota (Twin Cities) campus. We welcome public and private sector practitioners, researchers, students, and all involved in developing, analyzing, and applying transportation data and tools to connect, learn, share, and build lasting professional relationships.
