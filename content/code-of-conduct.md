**The Modeling Mobility Conference (MoMo) and the organizing Zephyr Foundation (Zephyr) are committed to fostering a safe, respectful, and inclusive environment for all participants.** We believe in open collaboration, the exchange of ideas, and the creation of high-quality, innovative work — all grounded in principles that guide our community and support the public good.

### Zephyr Guiding Principles

This event is shaped by the [Guiding Principles of Zephyr](https://zephyrtransport.org/about/), which include:

- Respectful and honest interaction
- Acting in support of the public good, specifically inclusion, equitable opportunity, and shared prosperity
- Diversity of opinions and backgrounds are proactively sought out and welcomed
- Lawfulness as mandatory

### Expected Behavior

All participants — including attendees, speakers, sponsors, exhibitors, volunteers, and staff — are expected to:

- Treat others with respect
- Communicate in a constructive and professional manner
- Welcome different perspectives, even in disagreement
- Abide by all laws and venue rules

Remember, your behavior affects not only those you interact with directly, but also others in your environment with whom you might not be engaged.

Harassment of any kind will not be tolerated. Prohibited behavior includes, but is not limited to:

- Verbal or physical harassment, intimidation, or threats
- Discriminatory or derogatory comments
- Inappropriate or unwelcome sexual attention
- Sustained disruption of talks or discussions
- Offensive, demeaning, or exclusionary jokes or imagery
- Deliberate misgendering or disrespect of identities
- Any other conduct that undermines the inclusive environment we strive to create

### Reporting and Enforcement

This Code of Conduct applies to any attendee of an event sponsored by the MoMo and/or Zephyr, including networking and other activities organized for conference attendees that take place after hours and/or off the site of the core event.

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, immediately report to a member of the MoMo or Zephyr staff. Alternatively, a complaint may be directly filed with Zephyr ModelingMobility@zephyrtransport.org. All reports will be handled with sensitivity, discretion, and confidentiality.

Violations may result in actions ranging from a warning to removal from the event, without refund, and potential exclusion from future events, at the discretion of the organizers.
