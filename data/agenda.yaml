  SessionTitle: 'Model Calibration: Panel'
  RoomLocation: Johnson Great Room
  Description: '<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong><em>It''s going to be a
    Calibrated (Calibrated), Calibrated (Calibrated), Calibrated Model</em></strong></span></p><p>We
    still frequently rely on travel models which are several years out of date to
    inform planning decisions. This panel will explore the latest perspectives on
    travel demand model calibration, drawing from both current and emerging practices.
    We will address key questions like: How often are we re-calibrating our models?
    Which data sources are we leveraging? How much time and effort are required for
    this process? Are there relevant emerging technologies? How would we use more
    frequently-updated travel models in our planning process? Ultimately, this panel
    aims to identify actionable next steps to help keep our travel demand models current
    and effective.</p>'

    from FHWA. GMNS enables easier sharing of routable road network files across platforms
    and agencies.</p><p>Participants will also explore&nbsp;Network Wrangler 2.0,
    an open-source Python tool that simplifies network editing through &ldquo;Project
    Cards&rdquo; - standardized, human- and machine-readable text files that describe
    proposed changes to roadway, transit, pedestrian, or bicycle infrastructure. The
    tool automates network updates, supports scenario management, and facilitates
    collaboration across agencies and software platforms.</p><p>This hands-on workshop
    will guide participants through building GMNS- and Network Wrangler-ready travel
    model networks from scratch using open-source data. Attendees will learn how to
    create network scenarios with Network Wrangler and perform network analysis with
    GMNS standard networks, including transit accessibility evaluation. Live demonstrations
    will showcase how these tools streamline network development and scenario management
    for regional transportation planning.</p>'

  SessionTitle: 'Exploring Post-Pandemic Travel Modeling: Panel'
  RoomLocation: Ski-U-Mah
  Description: '<p><em><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Work is a changing,
    Don&rsquo;t''cha Know</span></strong></em></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">This
    session focuses on the evolving impact of remote and hybrid work on travel demand
    modeling, transit ridership, and urban planning. It explores how traditional travel
    demand models are being updated to account for flexible work arrangements, the
    uncertainty these changes introduce in forecasting, and the methods being developed
    to quantify and manage this uncertainty. The presentations discuss the use of
    advanced modeling techniques, various survey datasets (e.g., ACS, ATUS, NHTS),
    and empirical findings to understand and predict shifts in travel behavior and
    productivity due to telecommuting, particularly in a post-pandemic context.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>'

    SessionTitle: Enhancements to a Risk and Uncertainty Framework to Consider Flexible
      Work Arrangements and Overnight Visitors
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p class="MsoNormal">Abstract</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Background
      to Problem</strong></p><p class="MsoNormal">Uncertainty in travel demand model
      forecasts can significantly affect the ability of transportation agencies to
      achieve policy and investment objectives, particularly in projects involving
      toll roads and managed lanes. Traditional travel demand models are subject to
      uncertainty in key inputs, such as traveler value of time, land use assumptions,
      and future network conditions. These uncertainties can impact revenue projections,
      project feasibility, and long-term infrastructure planning. However, addressing
      uncertainty typically requires running travel models tens or even hundreds of
      thousands of times under varying assumptions, which is computationally prohibitive
      given current model runtimes.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Description of
      Application</strong></p><p class="BodyParagraph"><span style="color: windowtext;">This
      study develops a synthetic modeling approach to efficiently quantify forecast
      uncertainty in travel demand models. The approach integrates an experimental
      design framework to systematically vary key model inputs while significantly
      reducing computational costs. The application builds upon recent enhancements
      to a tour-based travel demand model, explicitly incorporating the effects of
      flexible work arrangements and visitor occupancy rates&mdash;two variables that
      have exhibited high variability in recent years, in addition to the impact of
      land-use, value of time, and levels of network investment in the implementation
      area.</span></p><p class="BodyParagraph"><span style="color: windowtext;">A
      fractional factorial design is employed to capture uncertainty&rsquo;s effects
      of the five key inputs on model outputs without requiring the exhaustive simulations
      of a full factorial approach. This enables the estimation of a global response
      surface model, which serves as the basis for Monte Carlo simulations to generate
      comprehensive risk profiles. By evaluating forecast variability for planning
      horizon years 2035 and 2055, this framework provides transportation agencies
      with a scalable methodology for assessing risk in travel demand forecasts. Uncertainty
      is measured graphically by calculating the ratio of the 50</span><sup>th</sup><span
      style="color: windowtext;"> percentile forecast versus the 90</span><sup>th</sup><span
      style="color: windowtext;"> percentile forecast.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Why
      This Application is Noteworthy</strong></p><p class="MsoNormal">This application
      advances travel modeling by offering a practical, computationally feasible approach
      to quantify and manage forecast uncertainty. Unlike conventional sensitivity
      testing, which often evaluates a limited set of scenarios, this method enables
      a statistically robust and scalable means of assessing a full range of plausible
      future outcomes. The integration of experimental design principles ensures that
      uncertainty analysis can be conducted more efficiently, supporting more informed
      policy and infrastructure investment decisions. This methodology is particularly
      relevant for agencies evaluating revenue risk in tolled facilities, where uncertainty
      in travel demand can have significant financial implications.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Project
      Status</strong></p><p class="MsoNormal">This project is completed.</p>'

      \ in travel behavior since the COVID-19 pandemic has been the increase in hybrid\

      \ <span class=\"NormalTextRun SCXW335926 BCX0\">since</span><span class=\"NormalTextRun\

      \ trips could also be substituted between in-person days and remote days, thus\
      \ <em>displacing</em> VMT rather than generating VMT. Past efforts to quantify\
      \ these effects have been limited by data that do not capture a full week of\

    SessionTitle: Telework Assumptions and Uncertainties of Transit Ridership Forecasting
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: <p class="MsoBodyText">The impacts of the pandemic and its induced
      changes to telework have been extensively documented in the literature. Travel
      demand modelers and forecasters are now more conscious of the telework assumptions
      used in the travel demand models and have introduced ways to account for the
      potential effects of various telework assumptions on travel demand and ridership
      forecasting. In this study, we summarized our recent findings related to the
      uncertainties of transit ridership forecasting stemming from telework assumptions.</p><p
      class="MsoBodyText">Specifically, we have used an advanced trip-based regional
      model to conduct the ridership forecasting under various telework scenarios,
      in support of several planning studies in the Washington metropolitan region.
      Telework trends were analyzed using the biennial regional State of the Commute
      surveys conducted by the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments (MWCOG).
      Based on these telework trends and the baseline assumption used in the model,
      we derived several telework scenarios. These scenarios were then operationalized
      in the model, incorporating work-from-home rates differentiated by four household
      income groups, which reflects the survey finding that these rates tend to increase
      with income.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">We analyzed the impacts on transit ridership
      across three modes&mdash;commuter rail, Metrorail, and bus&mdash;both in the
      short term (2030) and the long term (2045). Additionally, we calculated the
      elasticities of transit ridership with respect to work-from-home rates for both
      peak and off-peak periods, demonstrating significant differences in the potential
      effects of telework assumptions on transit ridership in different time periods
      of a day.</p>

    SessionTitle: Exploring the Relationship between Work-from-Home Frequency and
      Perceived Changes in Productivity
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN"
      style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Over the past few years,</span>
      <span lang="EN" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%;">remote and hybrid
      work have grown, driven by COVID-19 and shifting workplace norms. While their
      impact on mobility has been vastly studied, productivity effects remain less
      explored. This presentation examines how socioeconomic and behavioral factors
      influence remote work patterns and productivity. </span><span style="font-size:
      10.0pt; line-height: 115%; mso-ansi-language: EN-US;">The findings indicate
      that work-from-home adoption and perceived productivity are influenced by perceived
      health risks and socioeconomic factors. Furthermore, the results highlight non-conventional
      land use and behavioral characteristics that can enhance analyses of telecommuting
      rates across diverse socioeconomic groups and regions. Incorporating these factors
      allows planners and modelers to generate more accurate, data-driven estimates
      that reflect both regional and individual-level influences on telecommuting
      rates used in regional models, while also providing stakeholders with insights
      into the impacts of health, mobility, and work arrangements on perceived productivity.</span></p><p
      class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size:
      10.0pt; line-height: 115%;">This presentation approaches the influence of travel
      patterns, socioeconomic characteristics, and a range of latent constructs, such
      as perceived health risk, social propensity, and tech affinity, on telecommute
      frequency and perceived work productivity changes after the COVID-19 pandemic.
      The dataset used in this study is derived from the COVID Future Survey, a nationwide,
      multi-wave panel survey conducted in the United States. This rich dataset includes,
      but is not limited to, socioeconomic and demographic attributes, travel patterns,
      attitudes and perceptions, lifestyle preferences, work arrangements and preferences,
      and pandemic-related behaviors. The methodology uses ordered probit models with
      two endogenous variables, namely work-from-home frequency and perceived productivity
      change, both ordinal. The exogenous variables include person- and household-level
      variables, in addition to commute attributes. Finally, the unobserved latent
      attitudinal constructs work as intermediate factors in the model structure.
      Thus, the exogenous, explanatory variables may influence the two endogenous
      variables both directly and indirectly through their effects on the latent constructs.
      As the proposed framework contains two endogenous variables and needs to explicitly
      account for latent attitudinal constructs, this study employs a joint equations
      modeling framework, which allows error correlations across both latent constructs
      and endogenous variables. Preliminary results show that individuals with higher
      telecommuting frequencies and those who are more comfortable with engaging in
      virtual activities felt more productive after the new work arrangements, whereas
      those with COVID-19 concerns, under the age of 40, and lower income, perceived
      their productivity as decreasing. By considering these behavioral and attitudinal
      characteristics, models can be refined to better predict regional shifts in
      mobility patterns, inform policymakers regarding health and productivity perceptions,
      and guide future infrastructure needs.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:
      justify;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%;">This
      work presents results from a wide range of angles, it may improve regional models
      by refining generalized assumptions regarding telecommuting rates and trends,
      especially in areas with public health concerns or with diverse population characteristics.
      Insights may guide policy and planning by linking long-term remote work adoption
      to productivity, office demand, and infrastructure needs.</span></p>'

    SessionTitle: A deeper dive into telecommuting behavior using multiple longitudinal
      data sources
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: <p>This presentation builds upon "A Deep Dive into Telecommuting
      Behavior" that was presented at the TRB Innovations and Applications conference
      in 2023.&nbsp; In this new presentation, the analysis is extended to use data
      from 2022, 2023 and 2024, providing post-pandemic evidence. More importantly,
      in addition to using American Communities Survey (ACS) data from 2006 to 2023,
      this analysis also uses the annual American Time Use Survey (ATUS) data for
      2006 to 2024. The two surveys can be used to measure telecommuting in different
      ways, with ACS simply asking whether or not a worker usually telecommutes to
      work, and the ATUS data containing detailed activity codes for each 15 minutes
      during a single day. .&nbsp;</p><p>Somewhat surprisingly, the ACS and ATUS data
      show very similer trends in percentage changes in telecommuting across the years,
      although the absolute levels differ due to the way that telecommuting can be
      measured with the very different survey data.&nbsp; These large, long-term national
      datasets allow investigation into many factors that are correlated with differing
      telecommute rates, including profession and employer type (levels of government,
      private, self, etc), as well as a wide range of socio-economic factors.&nbsp;</p><p>Also
      presented is an analysis of relationships between telecommute behavior and the
      amount of time spent in physical activityies. walking and biking). While the
      ACS data is not useful for such an analysis, the ATUS data are well-designed
      for looking at this relationship to determine whether telecommuting and phyisical
      activity levels are more often substitutes or complimentary, and how the rise
      of telecommuting during and after the pandemic have affected this relationship.
      The data indicates that, particulary since the COVID pandemic led to a rise
      in teleworking, people who telework spend signiciantly more time in participating
      in physical activities on that day, more than compensating for the decrease
      in time that some would spend walking or cycling to work.&nbsp;</p>

    SessionTitle: Preparing the Twin Cities Model for Pandemic-Related Uncertainty
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: <p class="BodyParagraph"><strong>Background</strong></p><p class="BodyParagraph">In
      2019, the Metropolitan Council undertook a major model improvement by upgrading
      their model to ActivitySim. The model was initially calibrated in and validated
      to 2018 household survey data. In 2021, the Council collected another round
      of household survey data. These two datasets were compared to show differences
      on how these should be used to calibrate the model.&nbsp;</p><p class="BodyParagraph">In
      the process of calibrating the model with 2021 data, the survey datasets were
      compared to illustrate the differences that exist between the two datasets.
      The comparison was specific to data that an activity-based model would use for
      calibration. One of the resulting model features that was implemented in the
      Council&rsquo;s model is a factor that adjusts the work-from-home, telecommute
      frequency, and daily activity pattern models to pre-pandemic conditions. The
      non-mandatory tour frequency, joint tours, and mode choice models do not adjust
      based on the factor but are affected by the models that can adjust.</p><p class="BodyParagraph"><strong>Description
      of Application</strong></p><p class="BodyParagraph">This application seeks to
      test this factor and ask the hypothetical question of what happens if we return
      halfway and entirely to pre-pandemic conditions. The comparisons will be large-scale
      and compare the outputs of these two models to both the 2018 and 2021 survey
      datasets.</p><p class="BodyParagraph"><strong>Statement on Why Abstract is Noteworthy</strong></p><p
      class="BodyParagraph">Uncertainty has become a major discussion point. Following
      the release of the Transportation Model Improvement Program publication &ldquo;Transportation
      Planning for Uncertain Times&rdquo; in July 2022, the Transportation Research
      Board (TRB) Transportation Modeling Committee launched a book club and subcommittee
      (RIP) to help quantify the impact of uncertainty. At the 2025 TRB Annual Meeting,
      multiple posters and a well-attended Thursday morning workshop were presented.
      The issue with uncertainty is not a flash-in-the-pan, it is a reality that we
      all must address. This project is a step in the direction of addressing one
      component of the issue in a situation where we were fortunate enough to have
      good before-and-after data.</p><p class="BodyParagraph">In addition to the reality
      of uncertainty, the Metropolitan Council model is open-source, as is ActivitySim.
      The implementation of this adjustment is included in their source code and available
      for implementation by others, whether it is directly in ActivitySim or ported
      to another platform.</p><p class="BodyParagraph">&nbsp;</p>

  RoomLocation: Johnson Great Room
  Description: '<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><em><strong>Big Data, Big Ideas,
    so Little Time</strong></em></span></p><p>This session focuses on the evolving
    landscape of transportation planning and modeling through the lens of big data,
    with a particular emphasis on addressing data biases and leveraging diverse data
    sources for more accurate and equitable insights. Presentations cover the challenges
    and opportunities of using crowdsourced data (like Strava) for active transportation,
    the validation and application of commercial GPS data (INRIX) for origin-destination
    analysis and travel demand modeling, and the strategic use of various geolocation
    big data sources (LBS, CV, TSP) for different planning needs. Additionally, the
    session explores the economic impact of transit systems on real estate development
    and the use of radar data for identifying speed violators and their correlation
    with crashes. A key theme is the shift in travel behaviors due to external factors
    like the COVID-19 pandemic and e-commerce growth, and the advancements in household
    travel survey methodologies.</p>'

    SessionTitle: Understanding Representativeness in Crowdsourced Apps Data for Bicyclists
      and Pedestrians
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt:
      auto; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt;
      font-family: ''Times New Roman'',serif; mso-fareast-font-family: ''Times New
      Roman'';">The rise of crowdsourced apps has transformed transportation research
      and planning, offering new ways to analyze mobility patterns. Among these, Strava
      stands out as one of the most widely used crowdsourced applications, providing
      valuable data on bicycling and walking activity. However, questions remain about
      how well Strava data represents the broader population, particularly given demographic
      biases that may skew insights and impact decision-making. Research indicates
      that Strava usage tends to be male-dominated, leading to the underrepresentation
      of women&rsquo;s mobility patterns. This disparity has profound implications
      for transportation planning, as decisions based on skewed datasets may overlook
      women&rsquo;s infrastructure needs.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:
      auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><span
      style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: ''Times New Roman'',serif; mso-fareast-font-family:
      ''Times New Roman'';">This study investigates gender imbalance in Strava data
      usage through a comprehensive review of existing literature and an analysis
      of publicly available datasets. Women&rsquo;s mobility behavior is often characterized
      by trip chaining, off-peak travel, and a preference for routes perceived as
      safer. These patterns may not align with the activity-focused nature of Strava
      users. As a result, Strava data may under capture more routine travel patterns
      associated with women&rsquo;s mobility needs. Beyond gender imbalances, Strava
      data also exhibits spatial and socioeconomic biases. High-income, urban areas
      tend to have more Strava users, whereas lower-income communities and rural areas
      are often underrepresented. The findings suggest that while Strava provides
      valuable information on high-usage corridors and emerging mobility trends, it
      does not fully reflect the diversity of active transportation users.</span></p><p
      class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto;
      text-align: justify; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family:
      ''Times New Roman'',serif; mso-fareast-font-family: ''Times New Roman'';">Addressing
      these biases requires methodological refinements and data integration strategies.
      First, we recommend supplementing Strava data with more representative sources,
      such as census-based travel data, and targeted data collection efforts focused
      on underrepresented groups. Additionally, statistical weighting techniques and
      machine learning models can be employed to adjust for gender and socioeconomic
      disparities, ensuring a more balanced analysis.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"
      style="mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; text-align: justify;
      line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: ''Times New
      Roman'',serif; mso-fareast-font-family: ''Times New Roman'';">The implications
      of this study extend beyond data accuracy, directly influencing transportation
      policies and infrastructure investments. Gender-responsive and equity-focused
      transportation planning requires a comprehensive understanding of all users&rsquo;
      needs, which is currently hindered by data limitations. This study underscores
      the need for more inclusive data collection practices. By improving the representativeness
      of crowdsourced mobility data, planners and policymakers can make more effective
      decisions, ultimately fostering more accessible active transportation networks
      for all users.</span></p>'

    SessionTitle: 'Harnessing the Power of Big Data in Transportation Planning: A
      Comparative Analysis of High Accuracy Geolocation Data Sources'
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: <p dir="ltr">This presentation is about the use of the various types
      of Big Data in transportation planning and modelling applications with actual
      public planning examples to support our findings.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">There
      is not a universal best data source that will always provide the most accurate
      and reliable results in every circumstance. Rather, even though all data sources
      have value, that value is driven by the attributes or applications that need
      to be planned, measured or modelled. We, therefore, strongly recommend a two-step
      process. First, determine what needs to be measured or modelled. Then, select
      the data source that best meets this need.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">The main
      three high accuracy geolocation Big Data sources are:</p><ul><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p
      dir="ltr" role="presentation">GPS data obtained from smartphone applications,
      also known as Location Based Services or LBS.</p></li><li dir="ltr" aria-level="1"><p
      dir="ltr" role="presentation">GPS data derived from devices installed in cars.
      This data can be provided either directly or indirectly by the car manufacturer
      (OEM&rsquo;s). It is known as Connected Vehicle or CV data.</p></li><li dir="ltr"
      aria-level="1"><p dir="ltr" role="presentation">GPS data derived from devices
      installed as a component of a fleet management system in cars, light commercial
      vehicles or heavy trucks. Data from these devices is gathered by Telematics
      Service Providers, and the data is&nbsp; known as TSP data.&nbsp;</p></li></ul><p
      dir="ltr">Although many derivative datasets can be obtained from these three
      data sources for use in transportation planning or modelling, we will focus
      on Demand Analysis, also known as Origin-Destination Matrices (O-D Matrices)
      The differences in technical features between each data source creates significant
      variations between the O-D Matrices that can be generated from each source.&nbsp;</p><p
      dir="ltr">For example, data required for transit planning can be successfully
      generated by a combination of LBS data and TSP data. A robust, long distance
      travel model can leverage LBS data to close significant gaps from what would
      be deduced from a parallel CV based dataset. Important insights about freight
      may be derived from a TSP data based study.</p><p dir="ltr">Several actual projects
      will be highlighted in the presentation to illustrate these differences. These
      projects include a Texas Department of Transportation and Texas Transportation
      Institute statewide planning model that leverages LBS data in order to close
      gaps provided by a CV dataset (such as different modes of travel). Another example
      will describe how a major port authority used TSP data for a study to understand
      movement patterns of heavy trucks to and from ports to optimize the traffic
      flow around the port areas. This information was not available from using either
      LBS or CV data.</p><p dir="ltr">To conclude, in this session we will discuss
      the technical differences between each data source and how the utility of the
      O-D output is impacted. We will use actual projects to demonstrate and support
      our findings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

    SessionTitle: 'Evaluating GPS Data Sample Rates: A Case Study of INRIX Data in
      Texas'
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p style="text-align: justify;">Using passive Big Data for Origin-Destination
      (O-D) analysis has gained interest in transportation planning in recent years.
      Among many diverse types of passive data sources, GPS location data collected
      from mobile devices, vehicles and telematics devices demonstrate superior accuracy,
      consistency, and richness of detail. Hence, it is observed to play a prominent
      role in many transportation planning and mobility studies. However, passively
      collected GPS location data typically represents only a sample of traveler movements
      within a study area and must be expanded to fully quantify the regional travel
      patterns. Therefore, understanding the sample representativeness and sample
      rate of the GPS location data is crucial for its applications in travel and
      mobility analysis.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The Texas Department of
      Transportation (TxDOT) has a long history of using passive Big Data products
      to support transportation mobility and planning studies, including the GPS location-based
      INRIX data, which provides vehicle trajectory and trip information for three
      vehicle weight classes. This study evaluates the sample rate of INRIX vehicle
      trajectory and trip data across the state of Texas by comparing the vehicle
      trip counts derived from INRIX data against the traffic count data compiled
      from the Texas Statewide Traffic Analysis and Reporting System (STARS II).</p><p
      style="text-align: justify;">This study began by pre-routing the INRIX vehicle
      trajectory data onto the statewide OpenStreetMap (OSM) road network provided
      by INRIX using map-matching technology. In this process, the segments of the
      OSM network where the INRIX vehicle trajectory data was available were identified,
      followed by implementing a custom geoprocessing tool to conflate them with the
      roadway segments in the STARS II roadway network, which contains traffic count
      data. Subsequently, a list of roadway segments with both INRIX vehicle trip
      counts and STARTS II traffic counts was compiled to facilitate sample rate evaluation.</p><p
      style="text-align: justify;">Using over 19 million INRIX trips within Wichita
      Falls, TX, this study focused on deriving per-trip expansion factors for INRIX
      trips through a multi-dimensional evaluation of vehicle trajectories and trips.
      Within the study area, approximately 75% of the trips had corresponding field
      counts from 257 locations. For these trips, Gradient Descent optimization was
      applied to develop per-trip expansion factors. The resulting distribution exhibited
      a relatively narrow range, indicating stability in the&nbsp;method, and achieved
      a close alignment between the expanded trip counts and observed AADT values.</p><p
      style="text-align: justify;">To represent the entire INRIX trip population,
      the study also addressed the remaining 25% of trips without field counts. Several
      approaches were evaluated, including an overall average expansion factor, average
      factors by trip length and vehicle class, and cluster analysis. Among these,
      the overall average expansion factor proved to be both efficient and adequate
      for expanding INRIX trips within the Wichita Falls study area. The final expanded
      INRIX trip totals were found to be closely aligned with the estimates from the
      TexPack model, demonstrating the robustness of the selected approach.</p>'

    SessionTitle: Speed Limit Violation and Fatalities in the Dallas-Fort Worth Area
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p class="MsoNormal">In the Dallas-Fort Worth area there are around
      one thousand radar devices, called side-fires, that collect traffic volumes
      and speeds every 20 seconds on each lane of all freeways. These side-fires,
      that are spaced on average one mile from each other, generate 30 million records
      of data every day. One important application of this data, among others, is
      the ability to identify the exact number of vehicles that are driving above
      the speed limit. The analysis of the side-fires dataset has allowed us to identify
      the locations where there exists a higher percentage of speed violators as well
      as the time and day of the week when this situation is prevailing. The findings
      from this study were compared with the geographic data where crashes and fatalities
      occur, and it was determined if there is a correlation between these events

    SessionTitle: 'Understanding Shifts in Household Travel: A Comparative Analysis
      of Surveys from the Houston Region'
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">Household travel surveys (HTS)
      serve as a vital tool for enhancing travel demand models (TDM), forecasting
      future traffic volumes, assessing regional transportation plans, and understanding
      evolving travel behaviors, particularly as societal, economic, and technological
      factors shape mobility patterns over time. Cambridge Systematics (CS) analyzed
      data from the Texas Department of Transportation&rsquo;s (TXDOT) 2023&ndash;2024
      HTS and the agency&rsquo;s previous survey conducted in 2007&ndash;2009. This
      longitudinal assessment offers insights into how travel behaviors have shifted
      over the past 15+ years, highlighting the influence of major external factors,
      including the COVID-19 pandemic, advancements in transportation technology,
      and changing consumer behaviors.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">A
      key focus of this analysis is the lasting impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on
      travel behavior, particularly regarding work-related trips. The widespread adoption
      of working from home (WFH) and teleworking has transformed commuting patterns,
      reducing peak-hour travel demand and altering trip generation for jobs which
      can be performed remotely. Our findings suggest that WFH flexibility varies
      by industry and income, with higher-income workers and certain professional
      and technical industries having greater access to remote work, while jobs requiring
      physical presence remain largely in-person. </span></p><p><span style="font-size:
      11.0pt;">In addition to changes in commuting behavior, we explore shifts in
      discretionary travel, particularly the effects of e-commerce growth on shopping
      trips and commercial vehicle deliveries. As online shopping has become more
      widespread, household shopping trip frequency has shifted. Comparisons of HTS
      data over time indicate that overall household trip rates have decreased. Previously,
      trip rates consistently increased with income level, whereas recent HTS data
      shows a plateau at higher income levels. Similarly, recent household trip rates
      by household size do not exhibit the same rate of increase. Notably, large,
      high-income households are no longer generating as many trips as they once did.
      This shift may be attributed, in part, to the rise of ecommerce, as delivery
      services replace trips that would have previously been made to brick-and-mortar
      stores. At the same time, this shift has contributed to increased last-mile
      freight activity, as commercial vehicles make more frequent residential deliveries.
      </span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">Beyond behavioral changes, this
      study evaluates the evolution of travel modes. The emergence of new mobility
      options, such as transportation network companies (TNCs) has influenced mode
      choice and accessibility. By analyzing survey responses across different travel
      modes, we assess how TNCs have integrated into the transportation landscape,
      whether they have replaced personal vehicle trips or supplemented public transit.
      We also examine transit ridership trends in light of these emerging options
      and other external factors.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;">Additionally,
      a significant aspect of this study is the transpiration in survey collection
      methodologies. HGAC&rsquo;s 2007-2009 HTS relied on traditional paper-based
      household travel diaries, requiring participants to manually record their trips.
      In contrast, the 2023-2024 survey incorporates an online portal as well as smartphone
      GPS-based data collection, offering the potential for more precise trip details,
      reduced respondent burden, and improved data accuracy. While some do not use
      the app by choice or lack of access, the increased capture of trip information
      is worth its inclusion.</span></p>'

    SessionTitle: 'New Methods for Measuring Regional Mobility: Augmenting a Regional
      Travel Model with Big Data'
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p>Agencies increasingly look for ways that &ldquo;big&rdquo; data
      sources can complement existing model capabilities. Metro (Portland, Oregon''s
      MPO) recently overhauled its Regional Mobility Policy (RMP), creating new demands
      on the modeling and data that support the policy''s implementation. A core component
      of the updated RMP is "throughway reliability," defined by the number of hours
      per day that key regional roadways fail to meet a minimum travel speed, likely
      reflecting congested conditions and unreliable traffic flow. Throughways include
      both limited access freeways and local arterial streets that provide key regional
      connectivity for people and goods movement. Metro modeling and planning staff
      developed a new methodology to define and operationalize the new throughway
      reliability metric, leveraging the strengths and mitigating the weaknesses of
      regional travel models and observed traffic speed probe data.&nbsp;</p><p>Metro''s
      trip-based regional travel demand model provides &ldquo;typical day&rdquo; hourly
      average speed estimates for both base-year and future planning scenarios. Modeled
      speeds at this level of measurement are subject to well-known inaccuracies due
      to aggregation, shortcomings in traffic assignment procedures, and other limitations.
      Relative differences between scenarios are thought to be more meaningful. Probe
      speed data&mdash;primarily from the National Performance Management Research
      Data Set (NPMRDS)&mdash;provides nearly continuous data on traffic speed but
      only for existing conditions. Metro staff used probe data to establish base
      conditions, and then applied relative changes between base and future-year model
      scenarios to project likely throughway reliability into the future.</p><p>Augmenting
      modeled speeds with observed probe data increased confidence in the initial
      level of traffic congestion, while modeled changes allowed projection in future-year
      planning scenarios. Initial results supported a recent long-range regional plan
      update, helping to identify both predicted improvements due to investment and
      ongoing areas of need across the system. Comparison of modeled versus observed
      speeds in the base year also provided input into future focus areas for potential
      model improvements. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></p>'

      Study'
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p class="MsoBodyText">The Herkimer-Oneida Counties Transportation
      Council (HOCTC), is conducting a Planning and Environment Linkages (PEL) Study
      of the I-90 Exit 31 interchange in Utica, NY. Exit 31, a key regional interchange
      serving diverse land uses that faces safety and efficiency challenges. The study
      aims to improve connections between key roadways, increase safety, and enhance
      mobility for all users.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Key components
      of a PEL study include understanding existing and future travel demand, which
      feeds into traffic and environmental analyses, economic considerations and establishing
      a purpose and need for the project.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This presentation
      introduces a prototype travel demand model (TDM) tool developed to analyze existing
      and future network operations for a small Metropolitan Planning Organizations
      (MPOs). <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>These agencies often do
      not have forecasting tools, which are cost prohibitive to develop and maintain.
      <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>The presentation showcases how
      GPS data derived from TomTom, a big data vendor, was used to develop a model
      to forecast highway demand.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">The tool developed in
      this case utilized a street network and a sample origin-destination (O-D) matrix
      at an operational level from TomTom. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>The
      O-D matrix was expanded using available count data to represent demand for a
      typical weekday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The network was
      reviewed for accuracy and connectivity and its attributes leveraged to speed-capacity
      relationships.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">The average weighted trip tables were
      assigned to the network in TransCAD, a modeling software package. <span style="mso-spacerun:
      yes;">&nbsp;</span>The modeled volumes were validated using traffic count data.
      <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>The model was calibrated by adjusting
      network characteristics as appropriate. The base year validation was assessed
      using root mean square error (RMSE) and volume-count percent difference across
      various facility types. For interstates, the RMSE is 8%, with a volume-count
      ratio of -3.6%. Across all facility types, the RMSE is 30%, and the volume-count
      ratio is -5.6%.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The tool was subsequently
      used for future scenario analysis by expanding the base year trip table using
      projected socio-economic data for each zone. However, additional trips were
      assigned to a few zones to account for a new activity center under development,
      which is expected to function as a special generator.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This
      tool differs from a traditional TDM in that it replaces trip generation and
      distribution steps of a conventional three-step model, using an expanded trip
      table derived from big data. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>It
      is simple and quick to operate.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">The existing validated
      model can project future traffic by incorporating expected population and employment
      growth into a trip table. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>This
      helps plan roadway improvements and assess construction impacts. However, new
      major activity centers require separate trip allocation studies due to their
      significant influence on travel patterns.</p>'

    SessionTitle: Untangling ageing and age cohort effects in auto use and active
      transportation
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: <p>Using longitudinal data, it is possible to separate the effects
      of growing older (ageing) from the differences between generations (age cohorts)
      when modeling travel behavior. This approach has been used by the author and
      others to investigate whether Millenials traveled fewer miles by auto than other
      age cohorts, using data from the 1995, 2001 and 2008 National Household Travel
      Survey datasets. In this presentation, the earlier analyses are updated to also
      utilize the 2012-13 and 2022-23 NHTS datasets to see whether any differences
      have persisted over a longer period. The analysis is also expanded to also include
      Generation Z, and, more importantly, to also focus on the time spent walking
      and biking. Although ageing has a clear effect, with the use of active transportation
      decreasing with age, once the ageing effect is taken into account, each successive
      age cohort can be shown to walk and bike more than previous cohorts, all else
      equal. The analyses include descrete choice modeling of mode choice, as well
      as censored regression analysis of the distance and time spent using specific
      modes. The models are multi-variate, controlling for the effects of income,
      gender, employment status, household size and composition, and other socio-demographic
      variables.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      the rapidly evolving transportation landscape, a lack of timely and reliable
      data presents a major challenge for planning and modeling. Traditional household
      travel surveys, while valuable, are costly and infrequent, leaving gaps in understanding
      emerging mobility trends. Big data sources offer an opportunity to bridge this
      gap, but their reliability must be thoroughly assessed before they can be used
      to inform decision-making. Ensuring that such data accurately represents real-world
      conditions is critical for advancing the state of the practice in travel demand
      modeling.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt;

      need to reassess how well the model reflects current conditions. As an accelerated

    SessionTitle: 'COVID & telecommuting-induced changes in individual activity and
      travel patterns: Evidence from the Puget Sound Region'
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;" data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">One
      enduring effect of the COVID-19 pandemic has been the popularity of telecommuting:
      To this day, 23% of the salaried workers continue to work from home, according
      to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Using three waves of the household travel
      survey data from 2017, 2019 and 2021 in the Puget Sound Region, WA, this study
      examines how telecommuting, which also means the removal of the workplace as
      an anchor point from one&rsquo;s daily activity and travel pattern, affects
      the generation and rescheduling of maintenance and discretionary trips that
      are previously conducted around home and workplaces. The associated consequences
      including changes in modes of transportation used and vehicle miles traveled
      (VMT) are also investigated. We found that though telecommuting resulted in
      reduced number of trips and VMT in general, there is a significant increase
      in the number of maintenance and discretionary trips. Additionally, telecommuters
      also exhibited less complex trip chaining behavior, characterized by simpler
      tours with shorter trips, fewer stops, and lower mode diversity compared to
      non-telecommuters. Spatially, telecommuters conducted maintenance and discretionary
      trips closer to home; temporally, and the departure times of these trips are
      more spread out with emerging peaks such as late morning, and mid-day. These
      results have significant policy and modeling implications relating to transportation
      service provision, local economy, and travel demand forecasting models.</span></p><p><span

    SessionTitle: 'Data-Driven Transit Planning: Identifying High-Demand Corridor'
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: <p class="MsoNormal">Effective transit service planning requires
      data-driven decision-making, but traditional methods often rely on subjective
      analysis of complex flow visualizations. This presentation introduces the Foursquare
      Integrated Transportation Planning (Foursquare ITP) Corridor Identification
      model, a tool designed to identify high-demand corridors for high-frequency
      transit services using origin-destination flow data and an optimization algorithm.
      By pinpointing travel corridors with the highest ridership potential, this tool
      provides planners with data-backed insights to design efficient and effective
      transit networks. The Corridor Identification model processes origin-destination
      data&mdash;such as agency surveys, Location-Based Services (LBS) data, and regional
      travel models&mdash;through an optimization algorithm to identify corridors
      with maximum demand.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The Corridor Identification model
      is adaptable, allowing planners to work with different datasets, time periods,
      and trip attributes to reflect varied travel patterns. For example, the tool
      consumed both synthetic trip data from Replica and VIA Metropolitan Transit&rsquo;s
      on-board survey dataset to identify key corridors for San Antonio&rsquo;s VIA
      Best Bus Network Redesign, revealing areas where high transfer rates could be
      alleviated through route adjustments. Similarly, for WMATA&rsquo;s Better Bus
      Network Redesign in Washington, D.C., the model helped generate demand-driven
      corridors that guided service decisions, confirming the feasibility of proposed
      network changes. Additionally, the model has been used in the TxDOT Statewide
      Active Transportation Priority Network Development project, identifying potential
      trail corridors across Texas, based on the highest levels of active transportation
      trips. This effort helps ensure that the state&rsquo;s active transportation
      network aligns with real-world travel patterns, promoting more sustainable transportation
      options statewide. These case studies highlight how the tool not only generates
      corridor candidates but also verifies and justifies planning decisions with
      quantitative evidence.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The development of the Corridor
      Identification model bridges academia and industry. Originally introduced in
      a PhD dissertation as a mixed integer linear program, the algorithm was further
      enhanced by Foursquare ITP to serve commercial uses in the transportation planning
      industry. The model is thus an example of how academic research can drive innovation
      and meet the practical needs of transit agencies, facilitating collaborative
      solutions between research and practice.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This presentation
      will showcase how the Corridor Identification model enhances the planning process
      by connecting data to decision-making. Attendees will see how this tool can
      be adapted to various datasets and cities, offering a practical, open-source
      solution to improve transit planning. The model&rsquo;s ability to identify
      demand-driven corridors ensures that service redesigns better meet the needs
      of passengers, improving both efficiency and passenger experience.</p>

    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: <p>AEEMAT is an interactive modeling tool for predictive analytics
      of fuel consumption by traditional vehicles and the resulting air pollutant
      emissions, as well as electricity consumption by EVs and the associated emissions
      from power plants, under various transportation planning and investment policies
      in the Atlanta Metropolitan Area. AEEMAT integrates ARC's ABM with a sophisticated
      machine learning model, trained using the MOVES inventory and Cambium database,
      enabling accurate assessments of energy consumption and emissions from both
      vehicles and the power grid. The user-friendly interface designed for AEEMAT
      will enable comprehensive analysis of planning and policy scenarios, aligned
      with ARC's 2050 MTP.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

    SessionTitle: "Short\u2010Term Traffic and Revenue Forecasting Under Congestion\
      \ Pricing and Supply/Demand Changes"
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: "<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Abstract Background</strong></p><p\
      \ class=\"MsoNormal\">Conventional Travel Demand Models (TDM) produce forecasts\
      \ with aggregated inputs and fixed response functions, limiting fidelity for\
      \ short-term conditions when both demand and network characteristics change.\
      \ While time series machine learning (ML) methods perform well under stationary\
      \ network conditions, their accuracy declines sharply when capacity changes,\
      \ such as when widenings or closures occur. We propose a hybrid deep-learning\
      \ framework that forecasts link-level traffic volumes by fusing two complementary\
      \ evidence sources: (i) historical observations capturing real temporal behavior,\
      \ and (ii) CUBE simulations encoding counterfactual network changes (e.g., capacity\
      \ adjustments). The model couples a temporal graph transformer with a spatial\
      \ graph transformer and learns data-driven fusion weights to produce period-specific\
      \ volume forecasts. We chose graph transformers because this single model architecture\
      \ enables unified spatial and temporal modeling, aligns historical and simulation\
      \ data for joint inference, and scales effectively across network sizes and\
      \ forecasting horizons. While the primary forecast target is traffic volume,\
      \ the entire framework is developed within a congestion pricing context, where\
      \ understanding revenue implications is inherently linked to traffic behavior\
      \ and, thus, revenue is additionally forecasted.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Description\
      \ of Abstract</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">We represent the study area\
      \ network as a directed graph with nodes (zones/intersections) and edges (A&ndash;B\
      \ connections). Edge features include previous and current capacities, lagged\
      \ volumes and revenues, exogenous indicators (employment, unemployment, work-from-home\
      \ percentage), and calendar variables (day, month, year, day-of-week).</p><p\
      \ class=\"MsoNormal\">Two encoders operate on aligned but distinct views of\
      \ the same topology: The temporal graph transformer takes in historical edge\
      \ sequences to model autoregressive and seasonal effects, while the spatial\
      \ graph transformer takes in CUBE runs where capacity deltas perturb the network\
      \ to learn structural sensitivity. A weight (gating) decoder performs adaptive\
      \ fusion via learned attention over the two streams and outputs per edge.</p><p\
      \ class=\"MsoNormal\">Our methodology comprises five stages: (1) Generate training\
      \ samples by applying capacity changes at both the corridor level and the global\
      \ network level using CUBE simulations, and construct topology<span style=\"\
      font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Cambria Math';\">\u2010\
      </span>consistent graphs from these outputs while aligning historical transactions/gantries\
      \ to corresponding A<span style=\"mso-ascii-font-family: Aptos; mso-hansi-font-family:\
      \ Aptos; mso-bidi-font-family: Aptos;\">&ndash;</span>B links; (2) generate\
      \ and normalize features across both datasets; (3) jointly train temporal and\
      \ spatial encoders with a fusion decoder under a unified loss; (4) optionally\
      \ apply a corrective signal to the fusion decoder during training to guide weight\
      \ adaptation; and (5) evaluate performance using temporal holdout and scenario<span\
      \ style=\"font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Cambria\
      \ Math';\">\u2010</span>based holdout with unseen capacity changes.</p><p class=\"\
      MsoNormal\">Validated using real-world data from the I-66 Inside the Beltway\
      \ (ItB) Express Lanes corridor in Northern Virginia, the model produced an average\
      \ Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) in the range of 8&ndash;11% for temporal\
      \ forecasts across all gantry links, capturing both short-term fluctuations\
      \ and seasonal patterns. To assess performance under structural changes, we\
      \ generated predictions for 64 CUBE-derived capacity<span style=\"font-family:\
      \ 'Cambria Math',serif; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Cambria Math';\">\u2010</span>change\
      \ scenario graphs representing varied magnitudes and spatial distributions of\
      \ link modifications. Across these scenarios, the average difference between\
      \ model predicted and<s> </s>CUBE predicted values was 3.4% MAPE, indicating\
      \ strong robustness to network perturbations, with the highest error for a link\
      \ observed at 10.03% MAPE.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Statement on Why\
      \ Abstract is Noteworthy</strong></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">The architecture\
      \ explicitly handles joint demand and network shifts, enabling robust short-term\
      \ forecasting and credible what-if analysis under capacity changes. This method\
      \ scales to larger, multi-facility networks and as future work can be extended\
      \ to directly incorporate toll policy levers, enabling downstream optimization\
      \ objectives such as maximizing throughput or revenue, making it a practical\
      \ decision-making support tool for planners operating under evolving conditions.</p><p\

      and Big Data</p><p class="CSMemoBodyText"><strong>Abstract Background</strong><br>High-occupancy
      vehicle (HOV) lane weaving is often recognized as a significant contributor
      to freeway congestion, yet its isolated impact is rarely quantified due to confounding
      factors such as spillback from downstream bottlenecks, insufficient capacity
      at exit ramps, and other operational issues. To support an action plan by Caltrans
      to address degraded HOV lanes, this study systematically evaluates whether weaving
      maneuvers to and from continuous-access HOV lanes are primary causes of performance
      degradation on freeway segments. Advanced microsimulation techniques were utilized
      to quantify these impacts comprehensively. The study area was a 6-mile segment
      of I-5 in Irvine, California.</p><p class="CSMemoBodyText"><strong>Description
      of Abstract</strong><br>The study began with a pre-screening process to identify
      freeway segments most likely impacted by weaving. Using PeMS detector data,
      which provides lane-specific volume and speed, and preliminary Highway Capacity
      Manual (HCM)-based analysis, segments were evaluated for factors such as congestion
      patterns, ramp volumes, and the presence of direct HOV ramps. This ensured selection
      of a segment where weaving could be a primary issue.</p><p class="CSMemoBodyText">A
      comparative evaluation of microsimulation tools was conducted, focusing on the
      ability to control lane-specific calibration, model continuous-access HOV lanes,
      and flexibility in lane change behavior.</p><p class="CSMemoBodyText">The selected
      segment was modeled and meticulously calibrated in TransModeler. Calibration
      focused on replicating origin-destination patterns, lane-specific volumes, and
      speeds. Vehicle trajectories generated by the simulation were analyzed in detail
      to ensure accurate lane change behavior, a critical element in evaluating weaving
      impacts.</p><p class="CSMemoBodyText">To isolate the weaving effect, modified
      scenarios were created by adding ramps on the left-hand side, enabling direct
      exits from the HOV lane and eliminating weaving maneuvers. Performance measures,
      including travel time and the number of lane changes were compared between the
      base and modified scenarios. This comparison quantified the direct impact of
      weaving on congestion and overall traffic performance.</p><p class="CSMemoBodyText">The
      findings affirm the effectiveness of trajectory-based calibration in microsimulation
      modeling and the utility of the pre-screening process in identifying segments
      where weaving significantly impacts performance.</p><p class="CSMemoBodyText"><strong>Statement
      on Why Abstract is Noteworthy</strong><br>This work is noteworthy for its emphasis
      on detailed calibration and the measurement of weaving impacts through alternative
      analysis. Furthermore, it could guide the selection of cost-efficient treatments
      that deliver the greatest benefits in mitigating weaving-related congestion.</p><p

      \ are unplanned or planned events that cause disruption to regular traffic operation.\
      \ Roadway incidents&rsquo; root cause can be linked to work zones, crashes,\

      \ impact traffic performance causing increased delays, emissions, user cost,\
      \ and reduced economic business revenues. Roadway incidents may vary spatially\
      \ and temporally (e.g., short-term or long-term) eliciting varying traveler\
      \ and route choice behaviors. Proper modeling and evaluation of these disruptions\
      \ are essential for identifying bottlenecks, optimizing traffic diversion strategies,\
      \ and improving network resilience. Interstate 10 (IH 10) traverses the state\
      \ of Texas from east to west and serves a major corridor that supports economic\
      \ and social development in the region. This study evaluates the impacts of\

    Description: '<p>Application of Distributed Value of Time (VOT) in Agent-Based
      Dynamic Traffic Assignment (AB-DTA) for Toll Road Forecasting<br>J. Hicks, P.
      Vovsha, M.Mahut, I.Juran (Bentley), H. Zhu, A. Dutta (MAG)&nbsp;<br>Word count:
      473<br>The paper reports on the results of a detailed test of AB-DTA and evaluation
      of the impact of different assumptions on the distribution of VOT. &nbsp;In
      the AB-DTA route choices are individualized allowing each vehicle to have its
      own VOT. &nbsp;Tests were conducted for a large-scale real-world network of
      the Phoenix metro area with a hypothetical highway pricing project using fixed
      demand over a wide range of toll values.&nbsp;<br>Based on prior research on
      heterogeneity of users (Jiang &amp; Mahmassani, Tian &amp; Chiu), preliminary
      expectations were established regarding the relative number of toll users as
      a function of the toll value with the mean VOT by class and continuously distributed
      VOT. &nbsp;The continuously distributed VOT followed a theoretically established
      lognormal distribution with the same mean value for each class as the fixed
      VOT. &nbsp;The individualized VOTs were assigned in the Activity-Based demand
      model (ABM) as a function of trip purpose, person income, and car occupancy
      and corresponded to the VOT used in the mode and other travel choices. &nbsp;
      &nbsp;<br>Two sets of tests were implemented. In the first set of (simpler)
      tests, the demand was generated by the ABM and kept fixed assuming that only
      routes change with toll values. In the second set of (more complex) tests the
      integrated ABM-DTA model was applied allowing for a more complete response including
      demand as well as route choice. &nbsp;The implemented tests provided important
      insights with recommendations for toll road traffic and revenue forecasting:<br>&bull;
      &nbsp; &nbsp;There is a substantial difference between the mean VOT and continuously
      distributed VOT results, indicating that VOT setting (distributed VOT vs. constant
      class-based VOT) is an important factor that must be considered carefully. &nbsp;In
      general, continuously distributed VOT is more realistic, and use of this VOT
      setting and corresponding AB-DTA should be utilized going forward as the main
      tool for analysis of toll scenarios. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;For
      a given value of mean VOT, ignoring the VOT distribution results in a systematic
      overestimation of toll traffic and revenue for lower toll values and systematic
      underestimation for higher toll values. &nbsp;For lower tolls, the mean VOT
      exhibits a higher volume of toll users since only the continuously distributed
      VOT scenario can contain vehicles with very low VOT that would respond to these
      levels. For higher tolls, the continuously distributed VOT exhibits a higher
      volume of toll users since only the continuously distributed VOT scenario can
      contain vehicles with very high VOT that would not be affected at these levels.
      &nbsp;<br>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;The demonstrated magnitude of these systematic
      biases warrants a word of caution for utilizing simplified VOT settings in practice.&nbsp;<br>&bull;
      &nbsp; &nbsp;Given the fact that advanced ABMs today are characterized by a
      detailed segmentation of travel (and can naturally incorporate continuously
      distributed VOT within each segment), AB-DTA represents the best network model
      for an integration with ABM that preserves a full consistency of individual
      VOT between these two models. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>'

    SessionTitle: Accelerating DTA for Large-Scale Applications with a Multiresolution
      Approach
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><span lang="EN-AU"
      style="mso-ansi-language: EN-AU;">This presentation describes a recently completed
      full-day application of DTA for the metropolitan region of Phoenix, AZ as part
      of the advanced demand forecasting project integrating activity-based demand
      with dynamic traffic assignment models (ABM-DTA). The full-day traffic simulation
      of 20M vehicle trips in a large network represented a challenge where a broad
      range of factors and desired properties comes into play such as ensuring high
      levels of model convergence and practical run times. </span>Traditionally, run
      times are a barrier to growing these applications to metropolitan and regional
      scales.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">In contrast
      to typical multiresolution approaches that combine entirely different modeling
      paradigms (macro/meso/micro) in a discontinuous way across the network, the
      approach described here is based on a single underlying traffic model, which
      is a vehicle-based mesoscopic simulator, that can be solved mathematically at
      different levels of resolution. The key advantage is that for discrete simulation
      models, lower resolution allows for a major reduction in run time. At the same
      time, using a single traffic model ensures that the underlying model properties
      regarrding the representation and realism of traffic flow, and thus model results,
      are similar across different levels of resolution. This approach is similar
      to the idea of simulating packets, which was popular in some of the early work
      on flow-based mesoscopic models. This requires bucket-rounding the demand matrices,
      or, in the ABM-DTA context, extracting an unbiased sampling of households, which
      is a common practise for ABM.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:
      11pt;">We investigated the results of this approach used within an integrated
      ABM-DTA model, applied to a long-term future scenario for the regional model
      of Phoenix, AZ (USA), for assessing the impacts of managed lane policies on
      the freeway network. Multiple tests with different sampling and convergence
      protocols were implemented during the project where the results with sampling
      (low resolution) were compared to full sample (high resolution) model runs.<span
      style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We&rsquo;ll present some key results
      along with the savings in run time obtained with the multiresolution model.</span></p><p><span

      EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;">The proposed approach to multiresolution mesoscopic
      modeling is shown to greatly extend the practical size of DTA models, to metropolitan-regional
      scales, thus reducing the need for conventional multiresolution approaches that
      combine fundamentally different modeling paradigms. Moreover, for ABM-DTA, this
      approach opens a way to implement a meaningful level-of-service feedback in
      the integrated model at the individual level.</span></p>'

    Description: '<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span

      style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: ''Arial'',sans-serif;">Alternative
      and advanced fuel vehicles, including electric, hydrogen, biodiesel, and ethanol-powered
      options, offer promising solutions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and reliance
      on conventional fuels. Nevertheless, high upfront costs, sparse charging/refueling
      infrastructure, and vehicle performance uncertainties continue to hinder widespread
      adoption. While several policy initiatives, such as financial incentives, regulatory
      measures, and infrastructure investments, have been rolled out to address those
      challenges, the efficacy of such interventions varies significantly across states
      due to diverse local conditions. This highlights a critical need for thorough
      assessment of the policies to help stakeholders create more effective sustainable
      transportation strategies.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:

      style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 107%;
      font-family: ''Arial'',sans-serif;">This research conducts a nationwide analysis
      of clean vehicle policies across the U.S., focusing on their influence on the
      clean vehicle adoption between 2016 and 2023. The approach begins with compiling
      an extensive policy dataset encompassing policy details and the corresponding
      statewide annual vehicle registrations by fuel type. Leveraging large language
      models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4, the study clusters policies based on their
      type (e.g., financial incentives, regulatory measures, and infrastructure support).
      Such clustering addresses the challenge of overlapping policies, which complicates
      isolating the impact of individual policies. Additionally, the use of LLMs reduces
      potential human error when handling extensive textual data, improving efficiency
      and consistency. Clusters were validated by manually reviewing a random 10%
      sample from each category.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:
      justify;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: ''Arial'',sans-serif;">Subsequently,
      the analysis adopts a Difference-in-Differences (DID) statistical framework,
      augmented by a two-way fixed effects model, to estimate the effectiveness of
      each policy cluster in increasing the share of targeted clean vehicles within
      a state, while accounting for temporal trends and state-specific factors like
      geography, culture, and climate. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:
      justify;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: ''Arial'',sans-serif;">Preliminary
      findings (focused on electric vehicle policies only) suggest that direct financial
      incentives often yield robust increases in vehicle adoption, whereas infrastructure
      and regulatory initiatives have more variable and generally moderate effects
      across different states. Therefore, it is recommended that in states where infrastructure
      incentives have limited impact&mdash;typically those with existing robust infrastructure&mdash;resources
      should be redirected towards enhancing financial incentives, such as tax credits,
      rebates, and purchase grants.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:

      text clustering via LLMs with rigorous policy impact evaluation, offering an
      unprecedented nationwide perspective on clean vehicle promotion strategies.
      The automated policy categorization expands the analysis scope, offering planners
      and policymakers insights from a wealth of unstructured policy documents. The
      dual-methodology framework can guide tailored recommendations for different
      states, accelerating the transition toward more sustainable transportation across
      the nation&rsquo;s diverse landscapes.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:

      to prioritize projects under many uncertain hazard scenarios
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Background</strong></p><p class="MsoNormal">Travel
      demand modeling is highly refined for evaluating a few scenarios, but most models
      cannot quickly analyze the hundreds of scenarios needed to estimate project
      performance across a range of uncertain conditions, including those created
      by natural hazards such as flooding, earthquakes and wildfires. Therefore, when
      comparing projects for prioritization, it is difficult to place resilience projects
      (which show their benefit when uncertain events occur) on the same footing as
      capacity, accessibility, and safety projects.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Description</strong></p><p
      class="MsoNormal">The open-source Resilience and Disaster Recovery (RDR) Tool
      Suite, available to download at https://volpeusdot.github.io/RDR-Public, is
      a metamodeling tool for evaluating the return-on-investment (ROI) of network
      infrastructure resilience projects across a range of hazard severities. The
      RDR Tool Suite has been publicly available since 2023 and continues to be updated
      in support of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Office of the Assistant
      Secretary for Research. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>The RDR
      Tool Suite includes the Exposure Analysis Tool that translates hazard severity
      to network link availability, the RDR Metamodel, which uses a fast network routing
      model from the open-source AequilibraE project and concepts from the TMIP Exploratory
      Modeling and Analysis Tool to complete the scenario space, an ROI Analysis Tool
      that can perform Benefit Cost Analysis, Regret Analysis, or Breakeven Analysis
      for the user, depending on the information available, and a Benefits Analysis
      Tool to attribute project benefits among TAZs with differing attributes (categorical
      or continuous).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The economic analyses
      from the RDR Tool Suite are aligned with the U.S. DOT guidance on Benefit Cost
      Analysis, providing consistency with other methodologies and programs. <span
      style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Planning agencies can use their own
      road and transit networks, hazard, and travel demand modeling data to populate
      the initial analyses to kick off the expansion of scenarios and metamodeling
      approach.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Agencies can also use publicly
      available data (from OpenStreetMap, the Census, and other sources) to populate
      the RDR Tool Suite as a standalone model for estimating network performance
      across a range of conditions and projects. Both approaches are demonstrated
      in the documentation and sample reference scenarios distributed with the tool.
      The U.S. DOT Volpe Center provides technical assistance to users.</p><p class="MsoNormal">For
      several years, the Hampton Roads Transportation Planning Organization (HRTPO)
      has been using the fast scenario analyses of the RDR Tool Suite to aid in project
      prioritization, including using the RDR Tool Suite to analyze fiscally constrained
      resilience and other infrastructure investment projects and rural project prioritization.<span

    SessionTitle: Using a Mesoscopic DTA Model to Assess the Potential Impact of Closing
      a Key Freeway Segment Due to Flooding
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p><span style="font-family: ''Aptos'',sans-serif; mso-ascii-theme-font:
      minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin;">Enhancing climate resilience
      is a key strategy in mitigating the flooding risks facing Houston''s transportation
      system. The TxDOT Houston District identified a 1.8-mile segment of the IH-10
      freeway, located west of downtown and carrying over 200,000 AADT, as vulnerable
      to flooding from the nearby White Oak Bayou. This stretch of the IH-10 White
      Oak corridor has become impassable multiple times during past major rainfall
      events. In response, TXDOT proposed rebuilding this section of the freeway as
      an elevated structure above the floodplain.</span></p><p><span style="font-family:
      ''Aptos'',sans-serif; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font:
      minor-latin;">A regional mesoscopic Dynamic Traffic Assignment (DTA) model was
      used to simulate traffic&rsquo;s rerouting behaviors, assess congestion propagation
      across IH-10 and neighboring routes, and quantify the traffic&rsquo;s impacts
      using selected measures of effectiveness. This analysis was conducted for both
      flooding events and the subsequent repair and reconstruction period. The flooding
      scenarios considered both full and partial impassable freeways (i.e., capacity
      reductions to the traffic network). </span></p><p><span style="font-family:
      ''Aptos'',sans-serif; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font:
      minor-latin;">The DTA model simulate different driver behaviors on the flooding
      day and the subsequent repair. As flooding event is not always predictable,
      many drivers could not anticipate its severeness before they left home and have
      to reroute their path on the roads. On subsequent scenarios, drivers <span style="mso-spacerun:
      yes;">&nbsp;</span>are aware of construction closure and accordingly plan their
      routes before starting their trips. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span
      style="font-family: ''Aptos'',sans-serif; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin;
      mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin;">The DTA model identified areas of new or
      exacerbated congestion in the transportation system resulting from flooding,
      confirming the overall negative impact on regional mobility. Here are some major

      class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN" style="mso-ansi-language: EN;">Modern transportation
      planning and policymaking have focused on connecting communities through </span>equitable
      transit-oriented development. LinkUS Columbus initiative, which includes five
      Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) corridors, is a comprehensive mobility and growth plan
      aimed at transforming transportation in Central Ohio. <span lang="EN" style="mso-ansi-language:
      EN;">This study applied activity-based model to quantify</span> potential reductions
      in both air quality pollutants and greenhouse gases resulting from the implementation
      of the BRT corridors.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
      normal;"><span lang="EN" style="mso-ansi-language: EN;">Description of Abstract</span></strong></p><p
      class="MsoNormal">Central Ohio, one of the fastest growing regions in the United
      States, is anticipated to gain nearly 1 million residents over the next 25 years,
      resulting in a total population of at least 3.15 million. To accommodate this
      growth, the Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA) is modernizing the transportation
      system through the LinkUS initiative, which includes the development of five
      BRT lines. Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission (MORPC), the MPO for Columbus
      urbanized area, is one of the partner agencies for LinkUS collaborative initiative.
      MORPC conducted a study to quantify the emissions reduction resulting from the
      five BRT corridors.</p><p class="MsoNormal">MORPC''s state-of-the-art regional
      activity-based travel demand model was used to simulate two future 2050 (all
      5 BRT corridors are planned to be built by then) scenarios: one with the BRT
      corridors build and one no build. For network coding, some assumptions were
      made regarding the location of stops and roadway lane configurations due to
      the BRT corridors being in either planning stage or partial design phase during
      the study. The VMT projections in combination with local and default data sources
      were used for US EPA MOVES4 modeling to estimate county-scale emissions. In
      this analysis, emissions are computed and compared using two distinct methodologies.
      The first method followed air quality conformity analysis in accordance with
      the Ozone standards, focusing on Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) and Nitrogen
      Oxides (NOx). The second method was to compute greenhouse gas emissions in terms
      of Carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The findings, firstly
      computed for a typical summer day and converted to annual emissions, indicate
      significant reduction with the implementation of the BRT corridors. This study
      underscores the potential of BRT systems to significantly mitigate the environmental
      impact of urban growth and offers valuable insights for sustainable transportation
      planning.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN" style="mso-ansi-language:
      EN;">Statement on Why Abstract is Noteworthy</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal">Policymakers
      from Ohio Environmental Council (OEC) and Columbus City council''s priority
      was to understand the emissions impact of LinkUS BRT corridors to support this
      initiative. This study, applying regional activity-based travel demand model
      and US EPA&rsquo;s MOVES4 model, quantified emissions reduction from implementing
      BRT. Other planning agencies can replicate the study for justifying more equitable
      and accessible transportation systems.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

      Case Study from Southern California'
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p class="MsoBodyText">Travel demand models are essential tools
      for understanding the interplay between land use and transportation, allowing
      us to assess the impact of future demand on the transportation supply. These
      models are typically validated against traffic counts and transit boardings
      observed on typical non-summer weekdays to simulate typical "worst-case" conditions.
      But are non-summer weekdays truly the worst-case scenarios?</p><p class="MsoBodyText">Natural
      disasters&mdash;such as hurricanes, flooding, wildfires, landslides, and rising
      sea levels&mdash;can force large, vulnerable populations to evacuate, placing
      tremendous pressure on the transportation network. This highlights the need
      for resilience studies that identify connectivity vulnerabilities and assess
      improvement projects aimed at ensuring timely evacuations and emergency responses.</p><p

      Analysis Model (SBTAM) to support an emergency evacuation and network resiliency
      (EENR) study. This study uses the travel model in an unconventional manner,
      as evacuation scenarios differ greatly from typical conditions. During an evacuation
      event, both the transportation supply (available network) and demand (people
      needing to travel) can vary significantly based on the type and location of

    SessionTitle: Improving Destination Choice with AI
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p class="MsoNormal">This presentation will share progress from
      ongoing research for FHWA&rsquo;s Travel Model Improvement Program (TMIP) on
      improving travel forecasting using artificial intelligence (AI).<span style="mso-spacerun:
      yes;">&nbsp; </span>The project will ultimately result in the development of
      a &ldquo;Playbook&rdquo; for how to incorporate AI in travel models and promotion
      of the Playbook through TMIP webinars, etc.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;
      </span>While acknowledging some research aimed towards entirely replacing existing
      travel model frameworks, this effort is focused on improving existing models
      with AI-enhanced components. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>In
      particular, the initial focus of the project is on improving destination choice.<span
      style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Destination choice is the worst performing
      component of existing models, both trip-based and activity-based, and therefore
      offers the greatest opportunity for improvement from AI.<span style="mso-spacerun:
      yes;">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="MsoNormal">Given the project&rsquo;s focus
      on improving/replacing existing model components, together with the understanding
      that models used for public policy analysis need to be behaviorally explainable
      and defensible (not total black boxes), the study is particularly focused on
      Artificial Intelligence &ndash; Discrete Choice Models (AI-DCMs).<span style="mso-spacerun:
      yes;">&nbsp; </span>AI-DCMs combine the attractive features of AI and traditional
      discrete choice (logit) models.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>On
      the one hand, they can capitalize on the predictive power of AI, while at the
      same time, preserving the interpretability and behavioral realism of traditional
      discrete choice models (DCMs) such as logit models.<span style="mso-spacerun:
      yes;">&nbsp; </span>Roughly half a dozen different AI-DCM frameworks for combining
      logit models and deep neural networks have been proposed.<span style="mso-spacerun:
      yes;">&nbsp; </span>The different proposed architectures for AI-DCM models present
      different advantages and disadvantages for various choice modeling applications.<span
      style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>For the application of destination
      choice, however, the study is recommending testing TB-ResNet and L-MNL architectures
      which present clear interpretability in terms of bounded rationality.<span style="mso-spacerun:
      yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p><p class="MsoNormal">The project has begun with
      a review and meta-analysis of the published literature.<span style="mso-spacerun:
      yes;">&nbsp; </span>There has been some, but relatively limited exploration
      of AI for destination choice in the transportation literature, but there has
      been considerable work on the topic in the data science literature where the
      application is location-based marketing rather than transportation planning.<span
      style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Over 325 research papers have been
      identified from 1993 to the present as well as nearly 20 surveys/reviews.<span
      style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>As of now over 100 papers have received
      at least a cursory review, 40 have received an in-depth review and been summarized.<span
      style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Over 100 methods have been included
      in a preliminary meta-analysis based on 472 comparisons in 51 published papers
      using 112 datasets. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Preliminary
      results suggest that generative AI methods including generative adversarial
      networks and large language models perform best, but also indicate that semi-supervised
      learning methods, and convolution contribute to higher performance.<span style="mso-spacerun:
      yes;">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="MsoNormal">In the next phase of the project,
      which should be well underway by MoMo, selected methods will be tested and compared
      using real MPO/DOT datasets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Required
      data and runtime and computing requirements will be considered together with
      accuracy in evaluating the methods and recommending which should be carried
      forward for implementation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Following
      preliminary testing, pilot projects will be undertaken to implement the most
      promising methods and case studies developed for inclusion in the Playbook.<span
      style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The presentation will share the project&rsquo;s
      findings to date at MoMo.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></p>'

    SessionTitle: Integrating Agent-Based Transportation Models with Large Language
      Model Agents
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: <p><strong>Abstract background:</strong></p><p>In traditional agent-based
      modeling (ABM) frameworks and simulations for transportation systems, agents
      follow a set of ``a-priori" models of travel behaviors and use these rules to
      learn, adapt, and improve their travel plans and actions. The emergence of large
      language model (LLM) agents presents a novel opportunity to supplement and enhance
      these frameworks by enabling LLM-based autonomous agents to generate travel
      decisions dynamically based on contextual inputs. Trained on vast amounts of
      human-generated data, LLMs can capture intricate patterns in decision-making,
      language use, and reasoning, allowing them to mimic human-like behavior with
      remarkable contextual awareness. The integration of LLM agents into ABMs has
      the potential to improve behavioral realism and modeling flexibility in transportation
      planning and forecasting applications. This presentation examines the methodological
      integration of LLM agents into the ABM framework, with a focus on travel behavior
      representation and hybrid modeling integration.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Description
      of the abstract:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The presentation centers on two
      key questions:</p><p><br>1. How can LLM agents be designed to more accurately
      replicate human travel behavior?<br>2. How can we integrate LLM agents effectively
      in an ABM modeling framework?</p><p>We first assess the extent to which current
      LLMs can approximate human travel behavior. By treating LLMs as synthetic survey
      respondents, we prompt them with socio-demographic attributes and travel scenarios
      to elicit travel decisions. We then compare their responses against real-world
      travel behavior datasets to evaluate consistency with observed human decision-making
      patterns in real-world mode choice and route choice contexts. Our findings indicate
      that while LLMs demonstrate a strong capability to interpret travel contexts
      and socio-demographic factors, their choice preferences and valuation of attributes
      deviate from human travelers.&nbsp;</p><p>To enhance the behavioral realism
      of LLM agents, we integrate structures grounded in behavioral theories in the
      agent designs. Specifically, we equip the agents with a memory and perception
      mechanism that emulates human cognitive processes, allowing for more context-aware
      decision-making. Additionally, we implement a learning and matching procedure
      to align the agents' attribute valuations with those observed in human travelers,
      ensuring more representative and behaviorally consistent travel choices. Further
      evaluation suggests that these enhancements improve the ability of LLMs to replicate
      realistic travel behavior patterns.</p><p>Finally, we demonstrate the application
      of our hybrid modeling framework by integrating traditional behavioral models
      with LLM agents within a simulation environment to assess transportation policies.
      Using a mini-city case study, we analyze simulation outcomes in terms of agent
      travel behavior and network-wide traffic flow dynamics. Our results illustrate
      the proposed framework's potential for enhancing transportation planning and
      policy evaluation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Statement on why abstract is worthy:</strong></p><p>This
      work is notable as it is the first work to integrate LLMs as traveler agents
      into the ABM framework in transportation planning applications. Our results
      demonstrate the potential of using LLM agents to enhance the ABM paradigm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

    SessionTitle: Using LLMs to "Break Down" the Black Box
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p class="MsoNormal">Custom GPT-based tools, using LLMs as their
      foundation, are emerging as innovative instruments to bridge the gap between
      complex technical analyses and the broader needs of non-technical stakeholders&mdash;including
      executive management, decision makers, and the public. Insight Transportation
      Consulting has integrated GPT tools with the Central Florida Regional Planning
      Model (CFRPM 7). The CFRPM is one of the larger models in Florida geographically:
      it includes 11 counties, covers 20,000 square miles, and evaluates trips of
      5 million residents and 75 million visitors annually.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Our

      class="MsoNormal"><strong>Ask Me About CFRPM7</strong> provides natural language
      access to the detailed CFRPM 7 documentation, streamlining processes such as
      model installation, setup, calibration, and scenario analysis (800 pages in
      total). Users can, for example, inquire, &ldquo;How was the employment data
      verified?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Please describe the data fields in the roadway network&rdquo;,
      &ldquo;How were speed and capacity values assigned and validated in the CFRPM
      7 network?&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Please summarize the traffic assignment validation
      results&rdquo;. Users receive concise, contextually relevant answers that obviate
      the need to consult extensive technical manuals. This GPT has been released
      publicly.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The <strong>CFRPM 7 Traffic Data GPT</strong>
      provides natural language access to CFRPM 7&rsquo;s traffic modeling results.
      This GPT offers the intersection and roadway segment volumes in 5-year increments

      AM and PM peak periods between 2015 and 2045.&rdquo; Users can request downloadable
      bar charts and data files for presentations or other analysis. This GPT is currently
      undergoing public beta testing and is expected to be released publicly in summer
      2025.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The <strong>GTFS GPT</strong> (<a href="https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67a1694f44648191a0777c9c728008c8-gtfs-gpt">https://chatgpt.com/g/g-67a1694f44648191a0777c9c728008c8-gtfs-gpt</a>)
      provides basic editing of GTFS files with natural language query. CFRPM 7 uses
      STOPS as its regional transit model, so this GPT will help users modify its
      GTFS transit network. Users can upload a compressed (zipped) file of the GTFS
      files to request information or modify the GTFS files. &ldquo;Please modify
      the headway of Route #2 to 15 minutes all day&rdquo;, &ldquo;List all stops
      used by Route #101&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Add a new Route #101&rdquo; are some of
      the commands that the GPT can answer accurately. This GPT is currently undergoing
      public beta testing and is expected to be released publicly in spring 2025.</p><p

    SessionTitle: Developing a Statewide Land Use Forecasting Model with Integration
      Capabilities for Travel Demand Models
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Abstract
      Background</strong></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">The
      relationship between transportation systems and land use is inherently interdependent,
      necessitating the integration of land-use models with travel demand models (TDMs)
      for <span style="mso-fareast-language: JA;">precise</span> forecasting. However,
      large-scale implementation <span style="mso-fareast-language: JA;">encounters</span>
      challenges such as data availability, geographic resolution, disaggregation,
      and computational efficiency. This project addresses the need for a robust,
      large-scale land-use model that seamlessly integrates with TDMs<span style="mso-fareast-language:
      JA;">,</span> <span style="mso-fareast-language: JA;">thereby enhancing</span>
      forecasting accuracy and planning capabilities.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span
      style="font-size: 11pt;"><strong>Description of Abstract</strong></span></p><p
      class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">This project introduces the
      Large-Scale Land Use Model (LS-LUM), a gravity-based land-use model designed
      to generate essential socioeconomic and land-use inputs for travel demand models.
      While microsimulation and agent-based land-use models (e.g., UrbanSim and MATSim)
      offer high accuracy, their extensive data requirements and computational demands
      limit large-scale applications. LS-LUM overcomes these challenges by employing
      a Genetic Algorithm (GA) for calibration, enhancing accuracy while reducing
      computation time.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">LS-LUM
      forecasts population, household distributions, employment sectors, and land-use
      classifications at the Traffic Analysis Zone (TAZ) level from 2010 to 2050 in
      five-year increments. Its development was informed by a review of best practices
      in integrated land-use and transport modeling. Performance evaluation against
      established models such as the Gravity Land Use Model (G-LUM) and the Transportation
      Economic and Land Use Model (TELUM) demonstrated superior accuracy through R&sup2;,
      Percentage of Good Prediction (PGP), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error&nbsp;(MAPE)
      measures.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">After
      <span style="mso-fareast-language: JA;">developing</span> LS-LUM, its performance
      and accuracy were tested at different regional scales by various agencies, including
      Rural Planning Organizations (RPOs), Transportation Planning Organizations (TPOs),
      and Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) in Tennessee. Based on insights
      from these implementations, LS-LUM has now been fully integrated with TDOT&rsquo;s
      statewide TDM V4 and adopted by various agencies to explore different planning
      scenarios.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">To
      further enhance accessibility and usability, an interactive online tool was
      developed, allowing policymakers and planners to visualize and analyze forecasted
      demographic and socio-economic changes. The tool&rsquo;s intuitive interface
      ensures that stakeholders can easily leverage the model&rsquo;s insights for
      informed decision-making.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:
      11pt;"><strong>Statement on Why Abstract is Noteworthy</strong></span></p><p
      class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">This project has produced a
      scalable, efficient, and accurate land-use forecasting tool<span style="mso-fareast-language:
      JA;">, equipped</span> with a user-friendly interface tailored for large-scale
      applications. It adeptly addresses the challenges of integrating land-use models
      with statewide travel demand models<span style="mso-fareast-language: JA;">
      (</span>TDMs<span style="mso-fareast-language: JA;">)</span>. This powerful
      model is instrumental in assessing the cumulative and indirect effects of transportation
      projects, evaluat<span style="mso-fareast-language: JA;">ing</span> the economic
      impacts of various state and regional policies, and forecast<span style="mso-fareast-language:
      JA;">ing</span> land-use changes driven by rapid shifts in travel behavior due
      to emerging technologies. <span style="mso-fareast-language: JA;">Moreover</span>,
      it <span style="mso-fareast-language: JA;">enhances</span> the accuracy of residential
      location choices by accounting for evolving preferences <span style="mso-fareast-language:
      JA;">for </span>greener and tech-savvy lifestyle. The addition of an interactive
      online tool further empowers decision-makers by facilitating scenario analysis,
      supporting data-driven policies, and enabling strategic planning efforts at
      <span style="mso-fareast-language: JA;">both </span>state and regional levels.</span></p><p

    SessionTitle: "Evaluating Small Area Forecasting in a Rapidly Changing Landscape:\
      \ A Review of SCAG\u2019s SASVAM Tool"
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family: ''Times New Roman'',serif;">The
      Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG) employs the Small Area
      Secondary Variables Allocation Model, or SASVAM, to disaggregate population
      and household data into secondary demographic variables, which support a wide
      range of planning applications, including travel demand modeling, long-range
      transportation planning, air quality analysis, and project evaluations. SASVAM
      primarily generates inputs for the population synthesizer (PopSyn), which feeds
      SCAG&rsquo;s Travel Demand Model.</span></p><p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family:
      ''Times New Roman'',serif;">This study conducted by Cambridge Systematics (CS)
      and their project team assessed the effectiveness of SASVAM and provided implementable
      recommendations to enhance forecasting accuracy. The evaluation incorporated
      a literature review, interviews with peer agencies, and an empirical analysis
      of regions experiencing unique growth patterns. The findings revealed several
      key limitations of the existing tool, including reliance on historical data
      that may not reflect future conditions, inconsistencies in household size distributions,
      and population estimates that are incompatible with available survey data. Additionally,
      the model&rsquo;s complexity presents a challenge, as it employs hundreds of
      coefficients, making validation, interpretation, and updates difficult.</span></p><p
      class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family: ''Times New Roman'',serif;">To
      address these concerns, the project team recommended simplifying and improving
      the SASVAM tool. One improvement involves reducing the number of outputs by
      estimating age, race/ethnicity, and housing type at a mesoscale level, while
      maintaining household size and income estimates at the finer geographic scale
      with a streamlined income classification structure. Additionally, re-estimating
      the model to reflect the simplified structure and incorporate new data sources
      would enhance forecasting accuracy. Another recommendation focuses on optimizing
      computational performance by transitioning to SQL-based joins, improving processing
      efficiency. A further recommendation is converting SASVAM to Python, streamlining
      integration with other SCAG tools such as PopSyn and ensuring long-term maintainability.</span></p><p
      class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family: ''Times New Roman'',serif;">Beyond
      these recommendations, two special cases have been identified which require
      additional refinements: Areas experiencing new development, where the base year
      population or households are zero but increase in future years, and areas experiencing
      rapid growth, defined as annual growth rate exceeding 150%, and inconsistencies
      in household size distributions. For new development and rapid growth areas,
      the introduction of typologies with predefined characteristics would improve
      the model&rsquo;s ability to anticipate demographic shifts in newly urbanized
      regions. For cases where SASVAM-generated household size distributions are mathematically
      inconsistent with known population and household counts, implementing a household
      size disaggregation model would ensure accuracy. <span style="mso-spacerun:
      yes;">&nbsp;</span></span></p><p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-family:
      ''Times New Roman'',serif;">The proposed enhancements aim to improve the accuracy,
      usability, and efficiency of SASVAM while maintaining compatibility with SCAG&rsquo;s
      existing demographic modeling framework. By streamlining the model structure,
      updating its estimation process, and optimizing computational performance, SCAG
      may produce more reliable small-area demographic forecasts, strengthening its
      ability to support data-driven regional planning efforts.</span></p>'

    SessionTitle: 'Modeling Demand from Supply: household Vehicle Miles Traveled is
      explained by local and regional accessibility'
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p id="docs-internal-guid-87a42ca2-7fff-4bd0-7b9e-c4f37583c6e6"
      dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"><span
      style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #333333; background-color:
      transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration:
      none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">An important frontier
      in transportation planning is forecasting Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) under
      current and future transportation and land use scenarios. The most-used tool
      in this area, regional travel demand models, can provide geographically granular
      detail about expected future roadway volumes but are known to underestimate
      induced demand. Filling the gap are simplified tools based on long-run elasticity
      studies, but these are unable to make geographically specific predictions about
      VMT in response to network changes. Here we propose and test in multiple metropolitan
      regions an accessibility-based model, explaining household VMT with a combination
      of known demographic predictors and fine-scale access to opportunity data. At
      its core, our framework is simply supply-and-demand: demand (VMT) tracks supply
      (access).</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.38; background-color:

      transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration:
      none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Most previous models
      have been agnostic to land use, instead emphasizing household-level demographics:
      income, household structure, number of work commuters, and auto ownership. By
      not addressing the effects of the built environment on travel behavior, this
      research misses one of the &ldquo;five D&rsquo;s&rdquo; explaining travel behavior:
      access to destinations, here called accessibility. The accessibility of a household&rsquo;s
      location is a measure of the integrated land use and transportation opportunities
      at that place, a summary of the transportation supply in terms of what can be
      reached. Our analysis combines highly replicated, robust household daily trip
      data from state of the art surveys, with custom fine-scale access to opportunity
      measures in order to jointly model the demographic and spatial contexts of households
      to predict their expected VMT.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:
      1.38; background-color: #ffffff; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; padding:
      0pt 0pt 11pt 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif;

      normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;
      white-space: pre-wrap;">We find a hierarchical modeling framework, where response
      to multiple types of accessibility is nested within household type (see Figure),
      is stable and makes reasonable predictions for the scale of impacts of accessibility
      on VMT per household. Local accessibility (by walk and bike) has a small, negative
      elasticity indicating that households do on average have lower VMT when they
      are located in a highly walkable area. Accessibility by public transport has
      a stronger negative elasticity, which helps explain why households in neighborhoods
      of high transit access have lower VMT. Regional accessibility, defined by the
      amount of destinations reachable by car between 20 and 60 minutes driving, has
      a much stronger, positive elasticity with VMT, providing further evidence that
      expansion of freeway access and longer-distance regional auto connections results
      in higher VMT from households, all else held constant. These effects vary by
      household characteristic, and by region in the study.</span></p><p dir="ltr"
      style="line-height: 1.38; background-color: #ffffff; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom:
      11pt;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #333333;
      background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant:
      normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">This
      modeling approach and initial results will be of broad interest to planners
      and modelers interested in how changes to land use and transportation networks
      affect VMT. Specifically for states under mandate to predict and mitigate future
      VMT from construction projects (including the Minnesota state department of
      transportation), the approach provides a middle ground between the travel demand
      models which offer specificity but low accuracy in induced demand, and the lane
      mile elasticity calculators which offer long-run estimates without geographic
      context.</span></p>'

    SessionTitle: Using Trip Chain Simulation with Travel Survey Data to Study First-Last
      Mile Connections to Transit
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: <p class="MsoNormal">Understanding how riders access transit stations
      is a critical challenge for transit agencies seeking to improve mobility and
      equity. The Maryland Transit Administration (MTA), in partnership with Foursquare
      ITP and WBA Research, conducted an innovative study using trip chain simulation
      to analyze first-and-last mile connections to transit stops. This study leveraged
      MTA&rsquo;s on-board origin-destination (O-D) survey data and applied advanced
      trip chain simulation and validation techniques to enhance the accuracy of reported
      travel patterns.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Traditionally, the accuracy of on-board
      survey responses is limited to a respondent&rsquo;s recollection of their own
      trips &ndash; respondents often misreport routes, provide incomplete descriptions
      of their trips, and inaccurately report travel times or walking distances. These
      human factors create challenges in for transit agencies trying to accurately
      assess how riders connect to and from transit stations using O-D survey data.
      The trip chain simulation and validation address these issues by systematically
      verifying whether reported trips are feasible within the transit system. The
      tool also provided MTA accurate geographic information on where the respondent
      traveled, beyond simple origin and destination data, such as trip routing and
      transfer points. By simulating actual travel patterns based on recorded survey
      responses, trip chain simulation and validation ensures that trip sequences
      align with transit schedules, network connectivity, and logical routing.</p><p
      class="MsoNormal">This advanced approach enabled MTA to conduct a much more
      detailed and reliable analysis of first-and-last mile access than was previously
      possible. By refining the survey dataset through trip validation, the study
      provided a clearer picture of how riders reach transit stations, including differences
      across need groups such as low-income, elderly, or transit-dependent populations.
      The validated dataset allowed for in-depth assessments of transfer locations,
      walk times, and multimodal connections, offering actionable insights to improve
      station access and inform transit planning.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Through
      this case study, MTA demonstrates how advanced travel simulation techniques
      can enhance survey-based transit research. By ensuring data integrity and enabling
      a deeper understanding of access patterns, this methodology provides transit
      agencies with a powerful tool to address first-and-last mile connectivity challenges
      and improve service for all riders.</p>

      lang="EN" style="mso-ansi-language: EN;">Microtransit is an emerging mode of
      public transportation expected to significantly improve access to employment
      and other essential destinations for disadvantaged populations living in low-density
      areas. Although many transit agencies in the United States have implemented
      microtransit pilots in recent years, our understanding of these systems is very
      limited due to lack of empirical research. Utilizing trip data from microtransit
      systems in North Carolina, this study examines the relationship between the
      number of microtransit passengers originating from or arriving at a census block
      and the socioeconomic and built environment that generates or attracts these
      passenger trips. First, we estimate hurdle negative binomial models on the number
      of passengers traveling from or arriving at a census block in a specific hour
      of a weekday, aggregated over months for five different microtransit systems
      in North Carolina. To enhance our understanding of service characteristics that
      would contribute to greater demand, we combine data from the five different
      service areas to incorporate their distinct service characteristics as independent
      variables in our models. The models estimated separately for the five microtransit
      systems indicate that neighborhood socioeconomic attributes have a significant
      effect on demand. More specifically, areas with a higher percentage of females,
      younger populations between age groups 18-44, and carless populations contribute
      to greater demand across multiple service areas. In addition, the number of
      low-wage and healthcare jobs is also positively correlated with an increased
      number of passengers traveling from or arriving in a census block. For instance,
      a 1% increase in the number of low-wage jobs in a census block is associated
      with up to 0.109% greater probability of a passenger pick-up and up to 0.105%
      increase in the number of passenger pick-ups. </span>The econometric analysis
      of the pooled data from all microtransit services reveals that, after controlling
      for temporal, socioeconomic, and built environment factors, service characteristics,
      such as fare, acceptable wait times, pick-up/drop-off locations, and monthly
      service hours, are important determinants of microtransit demand. Among these
      variables, service hours and acceptable waiting times set by the transit agency
      display the greatest effect (elasticity). For example, a 1% increase in acceptable
      waiting time is associated with a 0.188% decrease in the number of passengers
      pick-ups. Furthermore, the results also suggest that, if other factors are held
      constant, a microtransit service with door-to-door pick-up or drop-off service
      would lead to greater passenger demand. An important finding from this study
      is that microtransit use tends to be more sensitive to service reliability (waiting
      times and service hours) than fare levels, likely because, in small cities and
      low-density areas, it is often the only viable mobility option for low-income
      and carless populations. In sum, the findings of this study identify common
      socioeconomic and built environment factors that drive higher microtransit demand
      across different service areas and offer valuable insights into the service
      characteristics that would contribute to higher demand. The findings of this
      study will assist transit agencies in evaluating the suitability of microtransit
      for their jurisdictions and in designing service characteristics to enhance
      the efficiency of microtransit operation.&nbsp;</p>'

    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: <p class="MsoNormal">Oregon Metro&rsquo;s regional traffic count
      program underwent a big change in 2024. AI processing of videos collected by
      our vendor resulted in a price decrease. This allowed us to class count, determining
      truck volumes, at every count location. It also allowed us, for a small additional
      charge, to order bike counts, for which the vendor has an AI procedure. But
      we noticed differences compared to other data sources, so we sought raw video
      for select time periods and locations to validate the data for use in model
      validation. This presentation will share the lessons we learned for those who
      may consider a similar approach.</p>

    SessionTitle: 'One Network for Ohio: Statewide and MPO Network Database and Management'
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family:
      ''Arial'',sans-serif; color: black;">There has been significant work done in
      the space of travel demand model network development including the use of open-source
      data for spatial alignments and leveraging data from state linear reference
      systems over the past decade. This body of work has in a common is a singular
      focus or application for that development effort even when they may share geographic
      coverage. Further models that are used for multiresolution model often have
      networks developed independently. For example, in many areas, the statewide
      model will have an independent network system and project coding from an MPO
      that is included in the statewide model aera. This independent approach creates
      redundant work as well as the potential for inconsistent project assumptions
      when evaluating investments. This presentation will discuss the benefits of
      developing a statewide multimodal transportation network that harmonizes the
      network features and characteristics of Ohio&rsquo;s MPO models and statewide
      model network into a single database and highlight the opportunities this creates
      for efficiency, accuracy, and consistency.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:
      10.0pt; font-family: ''Arial'',sans-serif; color: black;">Currently Ohio Department
      of Transportation maintains a statewide model (OSWM) and seventeen MPO models.
      The state has made significant investments to its modeling tools for the past
      several decades. It has one of the most robust tour-based multimodal statewide
      model platforms, and its MPO models range in complexity from the activity-based
      3C models to trip based models deployed in the smaller areas. The challenge
      Ohio DOT and its MPOs face is diminishing staff resources to adequately maintain
      the necessary input datasets to the high standard that is required for model
      applications. These include long range planning for the state and regions, project
      prioritization and project forecasting. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span
      style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: ''Arial'',sans-serif; color: black;">&nbsp;</span><span
      style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: ''Arial'',sans-serif; color: black;">With
      the use of a single network database that both supports the SWM as well as generate
      MPO model input networks, the state can better manage model application uses
      while ensuring project consistency and network accuracy within the constraints
      of less local staff resources at the MPOs. Such an integrated approach to a
      network database allows the stakeholders across the state to maintain and update
      their own model specific datasets from current up-to-date network data and provide
      them the opportunity to publish their own project coding back to the integrated
      network. This has the potential to not only facilitate local and statewide transportation
      planning and modeling, but to also facilitate the prioritization process by
      enhancing project coding consistency in Ohio. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span
      style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: ''Arial'',sans-serif; color: black;">This
      presentation will not only discuss benefits such as enhanced scalability of
      networks, alleviating the burden on staff to code networks, and increasing consistency
      across the state and its MPOs, but also address challenges such as dealing with
      different attribute naming conventions and needs, variations in the required
      level-of-detail of the network, and developing an editing environment that is
      accessible to the user base. </span></p>'

    SessionTitle: 'Untangling Linear Referencing System Based Network Connectivity:
      Innovative Strategies for Optimizing Network Performance'
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: <p class="MsoNormal">This presentation addresses the critical challenge
      of network connectivity issues in travel demand model (TDM) development, where
      discrepancies between modeled traffic volumes and observed traffic counts often
      indicate underlying network deficiencies rather than simply requiring volume
      adjustments. We present practical techniques for identifying and resolving complex
      network connectivity problems within TDMs, focusing on both the demand side
      (traffic analysis zone systems) and the supply side (network link configuration).&nbsp;</p><p
      class="MsoNormal">Our methodology leverages established principles from the
      trip assignment stage of the four-step TDM process, utilizing assigned traffic
      volumes to diagnose and rectify network inadequacies. Specifically, we analyze
      network links with zero assigned volumes to identify underlying issues, including
      an insufficient number of zone connectors,&nbsp;inaccurate link representation,
      and incorrect network link directionality. We propose innovative solutions for
      reconciling discrepancies between the network representation and real-world
      infrastructure, including techniques for&nbsp;updating zone connectors,&nbsp;adjusting
      link length attributes, and ensuring accurate network topology.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The
      Arizona TDM network, constructed using the linear referencing system (LRS),
      serves as a compelling case study. This network provides a valuable platform
      for demonstrating the inherent differences between true shape GIS networks (typically
      used for visualization and spatial analysis) and hybrid TDM networks (optimized
      for transportation modeling). By examining these differences, we underscore
      the importance of rigorous network coding and validation (based on understanding
      of trip assignment theory) for generating realistic and reliable travel demand
      forecasts. The presentation will showcase the TDM network analysis results,
      including visualizations of network connectivity issues, and network performance
      metrics, demonstrating the impact of these issues on the traffic flow assignment
      process. We will also present the outcomes of applying our proposed solutions,&nbsp;illustrating&nbsp;improvements
      in network flexibility and efficiency.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

    SessionTitle: Streamlined Travel Model Structure for Small- and Medium-Sized Metropolitan
      Areas
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p class="MsoNormal">While complex modeling solutions can provide
      valuable insight, the ease of use and practical applications can often be lost
      in travel demand models. Models are often developed to give the correct answer,
      but not to serve as useful tools for future studies. Meanwhile, small- and medium-sized
      Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) often do not have budgets or in-house
      expertise to develop or manage travel demand models. This can create a dependency
      on the original developer to apply the model and interpret results, which decreases
      efficiency and increases costs for any project involving the tool.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This
      is why the Streamlined Travel Model Structure (STMS) was developed. With a focus
      on providing the end-user with a user-friendly tool, the STMS <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:
      Arial;">is a three-step trip-based travel demand model developed in TransCAD.
      The STMS has been designed to have the flexibility to easily transfer the model
      structure to different regions without extensive familiarity of Geographic Information
      System Developer''s Kit (GISDK) scripting language.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span
      style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">While the STMS offers an industry-standard
      and customizable model structure that provides outputs by time-period as well
      as overall performance metrics and quick mapping capabilities, the primary benefits
      are the reduced time and cost of model development, as well as the ease of use
      for the end-user. Customizable inputs, such as time-periods or trip purposes,
      used by the model can be edited outside the script. Data fields are streamlined
      to prevent confusion. Adjustments to the TAZ structure do not require a painstaking
      process of adjusting other inputs or editing the script. This flexibility makes
      the procedure easily transferable and customizable. The model can be run using
      a simple and user-friendly user-interface. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span
      style="mso-bidi-font-family: Arial;">The STMS has been developed and deployed
      by HDR staff for multiple small MPO area models and continues to be enhanced
      over time. While additional customization of the STMS is always an option, the
      current flexibility of the STMS reduces the time and cost burden of developing
      a travel demand model and makes the model more accessible to non-modelers while
      still allowing for accurate outputs.&nbsp;</span></p>'

    SessionTitle: Estimating Regional Visitor Travel Using Passive Data for Travel
      Demand Models
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ''Calibri'',sans-serif;">Travel
      demand models are essential tools for understanding and forecasting daily travel
      patterns within a region. These models account for various travel markets, including
      household trips, visitor travel, commercial vehicle movements, and through traffic.
      Traditionally, data for these models are sourced from specialized surveys targeting
      specific travel markets, such as household travel surveys, establishment surveys,
      and external surveys. However, intra-regional travel by visitors remains an
      elusive segment due to the inherent challenges associated with data collection.
      Conducting dedicated visitor surveys is often infeasible because of obstacles
      such as the absence of a defined sampling frame, logistical difficulties in
      recruitment, and the impracticality of large-scale execution. While establishment
      surveys may capture some visitor data through intercept interviews, this information
      is typically insufficient to represent the full spectrum of visitor travel accurately.</span></p><p
      class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ''Calibri'',sans-serif;">The advent
      of location-based services (LBS) data has created new opportunities to assess
      visitor travel within a region. LBS data, derived from mobile devices, enables
      reliable identification of visitor status by inferring home locations, thereby
      distinguishing resident travel from visitor travel. However, it is commonly
      known that the LBS data suffers from various biases and often requires benchmarking
      and adjustment prior to its application for modeling purposes. This study explores
      two approaches to estimate the magnitude of visitor travel within a region by
      leveraging LBS passive data alongside ground-truth data, such as traffic counts
      and vehicle-miles traveled (VMT). The results from these approaches are intended
      to validate against each other to best estimate the visitor travel. </span></p><p
      class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: ''Calibri'',sans-serif;">One approach
      focuses on isolating the VMT attributable to visitor travel. This method involves
      comparing the regional total VMT extracted from HPMS reporting database with
      the estimated VMT contributed from all other known travel markets, allowing
      for the estimation of the residual VMT associated with visitors only. The VMT
      estimated in this way for visitors is used to benchmark the derived VMT from
      visitor trips in LBS data, which is then adjusted accordingly to become the
      final visitor travel estimate. In study areas where household travel survey
      data is available, comparing estimated VMT derived from the survey with the
      estimated resident VMT from LBS data offers an additional means to adjust visitor-contributed
      VMT and visitor trip estimates.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:
      ''Calibri'',sans-serif;">Another complementary approach compares observed traffic
      counts at external stations with the vehicle trips from LBS data routed through
      the external stations and estimates the adjustment factor to be applied to all
      LBS trips, including those identified from visitors. This method assumes that
      the nature and magnitude of biases from LBS data are consistent across all travel
      market segments it represents.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:
      ''Calibri'',sans-serif;">The proposed methodologies were applied to several
      study areas in Texas to support regional modeling applications. Despite the
      simplicity of the analysis methods, the results and findings from these study
      cases are promising, reasonably accounting for the specific regional contexts
      and unique economic characteristics of each study area. </span></p>'

    SessionTitle: Regional Quick Response Travel Demand Model Using Passive Big Data
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: normal;
      vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-family: ''Aptos'',sans-serif; mso-fareast-font-family:
      ''Times New Roman''; color: black; mso-font-kerning: 0pt; mso-ligatures: none;">Traditional
      travel demand model (TDM) provides detailed representation of regional travel
      demand, but it tends to be resource intensive and involves significantly long
      development cycle. Thus, traditional TDM may not suit the use cases for low
      or no growth areas, which could be served by quick-response modeling and scenario
      analysis. To this effect, the mobility data products from passively collected
      Big Data have shown promise as an alternate source to support development of
      such a quick response modeling tool. This abstract describes the development
      of a Quick Response Model (QRM) prototype by leveraging Big Data complemented
      with insights from historical travel surveys and other readily available data
      sources.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height:
      normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-family: ''Aptos'',sans-serif;
      mso-fareast-font-family: ''Times New Roman''; color: black; mso-font-kerning:
      0pt; mso-ligatures: none;">The developed QRM framework starts with a web-based
      data application that processes and refines the passive Big Data sources using
      cloud infrastructure (AWS) to produce seed trip tables representing different
      travel market segments for a region of interest. These market segments represent
      travel by population groups such as residents/visitors, travel modes such as
      auto/truck, and their regional movements such as those made within a region,
      entering/exiting the region and those passing through.&nbsp;The ability to segment
      the travel into subgroups and benchmarking/validating them either individually
      or as higher-level groups against separately prepared data sources is critical
      for assessing the regional impact from these travel segments both separately
      and collectively. In this way, the QRM mimics much of the analysis sensitivity
      and capacity from the TDM framework. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:
      0in; line-height: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="font-family:
      ''Aptos'',sans-serif; mso-fareast-font-family: ''Times New Roman''; color: black;
      mso-font-kerning: 0pt; mso-ligatures: none;">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"
      style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><span
      style="font-family: ''Aptos'',sans-serif; mso-fareast-font-family: ''Times New
      Roman''; color: black; mso-font-kerning: 0pt; mso-ligatures: none;">The QRM
      further refines the seed trip tables developed from passive data sources utilizing
      a sophisticated Origin Destination (O/D) Matrix Estimation procedure that calibrates
      the O/D flows to traffic counts, zonal marginal controls as well as regional
      Vehicle Miles Traveled to arrive at solid base year estimates. The calibrated
      base year O/D flow is then used, in conjunction with travel impedance information,
      to estimate gravity trip distribution models.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"
      style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><span
      style="font-family: ''Aptos'',sans-serif; mso-fareast-font-family: ''Times New
      Roman''; color: black; mso-font-kerning: 0pt; mso-ligatures: none;">To serve
      the forecasting and/or scenario analysis needs of QRM, regional socio-demographics
      and highway networks from both the base year and the scenario case are used
      as input to the estimated gravity trip distribution model to develop synthesized
      base year and scenario trip tables.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The
      difference between these trip tables is applied as the net change of regional
      travel demand to the base year trip table to become scenario trip table. In
      this way, QRM enables its forecasting and scenario analysis capacity. QRM uses
      the same traffic assignment process as in TDM to load the regional vehicle trips
      onto the highway network and develop network performance metrics.&nbsp;</span></p><p
      class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: normal; vertical-align:

      it also has a well-calibrated operating TDM. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>A
      comparison of the results for Wichita Falls from the developed QRM and TDM were
      favorable at regional, zonal and network link levels. This case study demonstrates
      the feasibility of utilizing passive data based QRM as an option for quick turnaround
      modeling analysis.</span></p>'

    SessionTitle: Bringing Travel Modeling to Small and Medium Sized Areas with Big
      Data
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: <p>Small and medium sized areas that experience a faster rate of
      growth and unexpected mobility outcomes are often not served well by regional
      models. Cities and counties that surround the urbanized core are often included
      in regional travel demand models but miss the network and demographic granularity
      needed to capture localized traffic and land use conditions related to the fast
      pace of development. &nbsp;As an example, several development plans can be approved
      at the same time, without consideration of their collective impacts on the road
      network, mobility, and air emissions like greenhouse gas. &nbsp;Through passively
      collected movement data combined with better scaling capabilities of modeling
      systems, the process to rapidly deploy models to address more localized traffic
      impacts is streamlined and efficient. &nbsp;</p><p>This paper dives into this
      streamlined process of creating a travel model in Sherburne County, MN. The
      model leverages big data to establish baseline traffic characteristics, a customized
      zone system, and internal/external trip patterns. This practical approach showcases
      how modeling is rapidly advancing in sophistication and cost effectiveness.
      The model supports planning activities such as lane closures, congestion management,
      and land use impacts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Discussion will focus on the following
      topics regarding the model:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Development, including big data
      collection and integration&nbsp;</li><li>Application - a case study of a transportation
      management plan (TMP) scenario&nbsp;</li></ul>

    Description: '<p class="MsoNormal">Research sponsored by the Federal Highway Administration
      (FHWA) to explore transportation cost savings opportunities led to the creation
      of an elasticity-based spreadsheet model in Excel to project how "repricing"
      transportation might affect behavior, household costs, and external impacts
      in 50 states.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Transportation repricing transforms fixed
      costs of owning a car to incremental costs of using a car, giving drivers more

      to vehicular mobility. This research covers conversion of the following costs:
      1) vehicle sales taxes, 2) vehicle registration fees, 3) vehicle property taxes,
      4) vehicle insurance, 5) at-work parking, and 6) leased-vehicle depreciation
      fees. Translating lump-sum to usage-based pricing encourages drivers to optimize
      their vehicular travel, yielding benefits in personal and societal transportation
      costs, congestion levels, and safety outcomes. The analysis shows how revenue
      policies can be designed and modeled to be revenue neutral and how much average
      household travel costs could be reduced by repricing.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This
      model taps state and national driving cost and other data and policy-specific
      data such as newer versus older vehicle fuel efficiency and annual mileage and
      market-specific parking prices. The model includes adjustments to capture rebound
      effects (increased auto ownership and fewer uninsured motorists) and separates
      out which drivers are affected by policies in each state.</p>'

    SessionTitle: Use of Mobile Phone Data to Identify and Measure Urban Barriers
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: <p>Mobile phone and shared mobility data are transforming how researchers
      and planners understand urban movement. These fine-grain data sources move beyond
      simple proximity measures to show how people actually navigate routes, respond
      to barriers, and use public spaces.</p><p>This presentation examines Loring
      Park in Minneapolis during 2024 as a case study. Using data from a mobile location
      provider, we track monthly visitation patterns, highlighting clear peaks during
      major events, and delineate a &ldquo;pocket&rdquo; of access defined by the
      Mississippi River and interstate highways. We then compare visitor trade areas
      and distance bands to neighborhood population characteristics, contrasting casual
      and frequent users. Publicly available micromobility trip data are used to illustrate
      how these barriers shape trip origins and destinations to and from the park.</p><p>By
      linking mobility data with the spatial realities of barriers and networks, this
      session demonstrates how fine-scale analysis can clarify who is and who is not
      accessing key urban destinations, and how these insights can inform planning,
      land use, and policy decisions</p>

    SessionTitle: 'Strategies for Neighborhood Type Classification: Connecting Built
      Environment, Demographics, and Travel Behavior'
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p dir="ltr">Understanding the complex interplay between the built
      environment, demographics, and travel behavior is crucial for promoting sustainable
      transportation. Neighborhood typologies, which categorize areas based on shared
      characteristics, offer a holistic approach to analyzing these relationships,
      potentially informing more effective land use and transportation policies. However,
      existing research using neighborhood typologies to explain travel outcomes shows
      inconsistent results. This inconsistency may stem from variations in methodological
      approaches, including the geographic scale of analysis (national vs. state)
      and the inclusion of socio-economic factors alongside built environment variables.</p><p><strong><br><br><br></strong></p><p
      dir="ltr">This research systematically investigates the impact of different
      methodological strategies on the development of neighborhood typologies and
      their subsequent relationship with travel outcomes. We address three key questions:
      (1) How do neighborhood typologies differ when classified at the national versus
      state level? (2) How does incorporating socio-economic factors alongside built
      environment attributes influence the resulting typologies? (3) How do these
      different classification strategies affect the observed relationship between
      neighborhood types and travel behavior?</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p
      dir="ltr">In addition to the common factor analysis and cluster analysis methods,
      we include the decision tree method that balances prediction accuracy and interpretability
      to classify census block groups into neighborhood types, using data from multiple
      sources. Built environment variables (density, diversity, design, destination
      accessibility, and transit) are drawn from the EPA Smart Location Database 2.0.
      Traveler socio-economic variables and travel outcome data (trip frequency, length,
      mode share) are derived from the 2017 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS).
      We construct neighborhood typologies representing data from different geographic
      scales (national, state) and variable inclusion (built environment only, built
      environment + socio-economics). We then statistically analyze the relationship
      between each typology and the NHTS travel outcomes.</p><p><strong><br><br><br></strong></p><p
      dir="ltr">This research directly aligns with the MOMO 2025 "Connect" theme by
      connecting methodological choices in research to their practical implications
      for transportation planning. By systematically comparing different approaches
      to neighborhood typology development, this study provides actionable guidance
      for researchers and planners. Our findings demonstrate that the relationship
      between neighborhood types and travel outcomes is sensitive to different classification
      strategies. The results will inform:</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li

      of the relationship between land use and transportation: instead of reducing
      the relationship to a simple elastic measure, neighborhood typologies make it
      possible to consider nonlinear and synergistic relationships.</p></li></ul><p><strong><br><br></strong></p><p
      dir="ltr">This research bridges the gap between academic methodology and practical
      planning application, ultimately contributing to more effective and sustainable
      transportation systems. It empowers planners to make data-driven decisions based
      on a better understanding of the complex relationship between place and travel
      behavior.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>'

      GPS-Based Travel Survey Path Data
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: <p>Widespread adoption of smartphones has revolutionized household
      travel diary survey data collection by integrating GPS, allowing trip-making
      to be detected in real time and prompting users to provide responses as soon
      as their travel is completed, rather than requiring participants to recall their
      previous day's travel.&nbsp; Smartphones have also facilitated multi-day collection
      and enable path information to be collected.&nbsp; The GPS path data has been
      underutilized relative to the core household, person, and trip information that
      household travel surveys have traditionally provided.&nbsp; The Metropolitan
      Transportation Commission and San Francisco County Transportation Authority
      have recently begun to leverage GPS path data collected with the 2023 Bay Area
      Travel Study (BATS) to develop user profiles of managed lanes, toll bridges,
      and other freeway facilities.&nbsp; We will present the methods for developing
      user profiles of roadway facilities, including routing GPS path data onto an
      Open Street Map network using open source tools and using weighted survey records
      to develop volume estimates and margins of error.&nbsp; We will then present
      user profiles for facilities of interest, including breakdowns by household
      income, race and ethnicity, home county, mode, and trip purpose.&nbsp;</p>

    SessionTitle: Envisioning a Statewide Travel Demand Model for Minnesota
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p class="MsoNormal">While Minnesota has long considered the idea
      of a statewide travel demand model, new requirements to assess the GHG and VMT
      impacts of highway expansion projects tipped the scales to finally confirm the
      need for one. Updated transportation legislation in 2024 authorizes MnDOT to
      make a substantial investment in a statewide model over the next few years.
      This presentation will highlight the initial scoping of the statewide model
      conducted to help frame what the model might look like and how it can be applied
      to a host of transportation investment and policy questions in the years to
      come.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The scoping exercise included an extensive search
      of statewide modeling underway across the country, including a deep dive into
      models for Georgia, Oregon, and Wisconsin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;
      </span>This was followed by an interactive workshop with a diverse group of
      stakeholders to gather their perspectives on desired characteristics and applications
      for a new statewide travel demand model.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;
      </span>A variety of statewide model scenarios were then developed and subjected
      to an evaluation process to assess how well they would accomplish MnDOT and
      stakeholders&rsquo; goals.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This work culminated in an
      implementation plan with a series of recommendations for MnDOT to invest in
      its statewide model capabilities.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The
      recommendations call for a novel approach that combines a strategic planning
      model with a tour-based travel model.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;
      </span>It was clear that a traditional travel model alone would not satisfy
      many of the expected use cases identified by stakeholders, particularly around
      behavior change initiatives and increased multimodal opportunities.<span style="mso-spacerun:
      yes;">&nbsp; </span>The proposed modeling suite provides opportunities to address
      a wider range of pressing policy questions, while continuing to support traditional

    SessionTitle: The Role of Trip-Based Models in Statewide Travel Demand Modeling
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: <p class="MsoNormal">This presentation highlights the evolution and
      current capabilities of the Texas Statewide Analysis Model (SAM), focusing on
      the latest version completed in 2024. SAM has supported numerous projects for
      TxDOT, MPOs, and other partners, helping inform transportation planning efforts
      across Texas. As a critical tool for long-range planning and policy analysis,
      SAM provides a consistent statewide foundation for understanding travel patterns,
      evaluating infrastructure investments, and coordinating planning across regions.</p><p
      class="MsoNormal">While activity-based models offer richer behavioral detail,
      the choice of statewide model architecture depends on many practical factors
      beyond theoretical pros and cons, such as state size, available data, project
      timelines, and staff capacity. For Texas, a refined trip-based structure remains
      the best fit. SAM continues to use a four-step framework with major enhancements,
      including a multimodal network (highway, urban and intercity rail, and air),
      two complete model streams for passenger and freight, weekday and weekend scenarios,
      destination choice for selected passenger purposes, explicit modeling of long-distance
      trips, and improved freight mode choice using Transearch data. In addition to
      producing accurate forecasts, SAM emphasizes usability, delivering outputs through
      streamlined Excel and HTML reports as well as an ArcGIS Online dashboard for
      easy geographic comparisons and visualization.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The SAM
      experience shows that with thoughtful design, ongoing enhancements, and user-focused
      outputs, trip-based statewide models can remain highly relevant and practical.
      This philosophy is also being applied in other statewide efforts, such as Arkansas,
      where limited budgets and sparse data require pragmatic yet robust modeling
      solutions. The session will share practical lessons from SAM&rsquo;s development
      that can guide similar statewide modeling projects.</p>

    SessionTitle: Develop a Mode Choice Model to Estimation Walk and Bike Trips in
      the Maryland Statewide Model
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: <p class="MsoNormal">The walking and biking traffic environment has
      been challenged due to increased number of vehicles, traffic speed, safety risks,
      insufficient facilities for active travels, and fierce competition for curbside
      activities. Current mode choice models on biking and walking, however, have
      two limitations. First, the trip-level information of alternative travel modes
      to bike and walk trips is often missing or limited. Second, the level of traffic
      stress (LTS) is a critical factor influencing travelers&rsquo; decisions on
      non-motorized modal choices but has not yet been incorporated into regional
      mode choice models in Maryland. LTS, which measures the traffic stress experienced
      by pedestrians and cyclists, has emerged as an important tool in the planning
      process for active travels by local transportation authorities. These limitations
      restrict the models' ability to accurately predict travel behavior and estimate
      travel demand for walking and biking. With the household travel survey and a
      comprehensive LTS dataset from Maryland, this study constructs a statewide mode
      choice model specifically considering biking and walking, along with public
      transit and private driving. We applied the Google Maps platform to acquire
      full trip-level information of all alternative travel modes for each trip, including
      routes, time, cost and distance. The results showed that LTS plays an important
      role in improving model performance. LTS has a significant and negative correlation
      with walking and biking. This study highlights that transportation planners
      and engineers should prioritize strategies, such as complete street measures,
      to create a low-stress traffic environment to encourage the use of active travel
      modes. In addition, LTS improvement projects should be strategically prioritized
      in specific locations and supported by targeted policies to maximize their impact.
      The resultant statewide non-motorized choice model can be applied to further
      develop strategies, policies and infrastructure planning for active transportation.</p>

      modeled data set with synthetic travelers and disaggregate tours that allowed
      estimation of models in a manner analogous to traditional model development
      from household surveys, a key advantage where no other detailed travel data
      was available.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Aggregate models
      were developed for a variety of reasons, including that the modeled tour patterns
      in the data were not always internally consistent.<span style="mso-spacerun:

      more recent NHTS data, models for these were also developed from Replica and

      was reasonable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Various challenges
      had to be overcome including the regional geographies used in the Replica data

      trips so while the model developed was disaggregate, it did not capture intermediate

      destination nor trips made by non-residents.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;
      </span>A new long-distance survey is available which was obtained via GPS capture,
      this included all trips over 50 miles (but not shorter trips on such long-distance

      which introduced additional challenges.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;

      </span>Reconciling these data as well as combining a StreetLight zonal analysis
      with an OD analysis to parse the trip matrices into resident/visitor and away

    SessionTitle: Nested Destination Choice, Decision Trees, Route Choice, and Other
      Innovations in Version 5 of the North Carolina Statewide Travel Model
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p class="MsoNormal">NCDOT is investing in a major update to the
      North Carolina Statewide Travel Model (NCSTM) to produce NCSTM version 5.<span
      style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>This update involves several basic
      updates to the model&rsquo;s fundamentals, processing and analysis of multiple
      sources of big data, and five advanced innovations including nested long-distance
      destination choice models, disaggregate machine learning trip generation models,
      work from home choice modeling, truck route choice modeling, and CAV scenario
      testing functionality.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></p><p
      class="MsoNormal">The new NCSTM5 will include a revised network and zone system,
      updated socioeconomic data to reflect 2022, freight data from FAF5, and a fully
      rewritten codebase.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The model
      will also make use of multiple sources of big data including ATRI, Transography,
      and Streetlight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="MsoNormal">The
      first major innovation in version 5 of the NCSTM is the development of nested
      destination choice models for long-distance trips.<span style="mso-spacerun:
      yes;">&nbsp; </span>While the use of nested logit models has long been common
      for mode choice, the use of nesting in destination choice is relatively new
      in practice and the NCSTM is believed to be the first statewide model to adopt
      it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The approach essentially divided
      the destination choice into an upper level choice of region and lower level
      choice of the specific zone in that region.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;
      </span>The approach produces much more accurate results allowing the model to
      far better replicate real flows between regions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;
      </span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">The
      second major innovation is the incorporation of machine learning to more accurately
      predict trip generation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The use
      of machine learning techniques such as decision trees have been shown to outperform
      traditional methods of trip generation in the Triangle Regional Model and have
      now been adopted by roughly half a dozen other agencies around the country.<span
      style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The new trip generation models will
      also be disaggregate, person-based models and make use of a new synthetic population
      for the NCSTM.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The use of synthetic
      populations in statewide models has increased in recent years in part due to
      the development of the fast iterative proportional updating algorithm in TransCAD.<span
      style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="MsoNormal">NCSTM5 is
      also incorporating a new work from home model.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;
      </span>The module will be based primarily upon post-pandemic household travel
      survey data collected in the Triangle and Charlotte regions and calibrated to
      the Census Bureau&rsquo;s American Community Survey (ACS) data for the state.<span
      style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>ACS data for the state shows that even
      though work from home has declined somewhat from its peak in 2020 and 2021,
      post-pandemic rates of work from home are still more than triple the pre-pandemic
      rates reflected in version 4 for the NCSTM.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;
      </span></p><p class="MsoNormal">The NCSTM5 also incorporates a new truck route
      choice assignment for long-haul truck movements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;
      </span>The method was first developed for FHWA&rsquo;s FAF5 and was found to
      better reproduce observed truck routing than traditional methods.<span style="mso-spacerun:
      yes;">&nbsp; </span>The model will be calibrated to ATRI truck GPS data specifically
      for trucks traveling within, to, from, and through North Carolina.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The
      final innovation in NCSTM5 is the addition of functionality to allow exploratory
      modeling analysis and/or scenario analysis of connected and automated vehicles
      (CAVs).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The new functionality,
      based in part on recent research by NCDOT, will allow for a variety of changes
      in response to the new technology including induced trip-making, increased willingness
      to travel, mode shifts, time-of-day shifts (particularly for long-distance trips),
      and zero-occupant vehicle trips related to car-sharing and parking avoidance.<span

    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: <p>The Ohio Department of Transportation performs annual evaluation
      and ranking of selected ky projects for project prioritization and funding approval
      overseen by the Transportation Review Advisory Council (TRAC).&nbsp; This year
      they are changing the economic evaluation model to TREDIS (Transportation Economic
      Development System).&nbsp; The travel demand data source is the Ohio statewide
      travel demand model which runs in the Cube modeling software.&nbsp; An automation
      process was developed to extract the modeling output and to reformat it as input
      for the economic model.&nbsp; The presentation will explanin the process of
      developing a user-friendly process of extracting the modeling data and show
      how the economic software is utilized in project evaluation.</p><p>The presentation
      will focus on elements of the analysis, especially unique features of the tools
      utilized:</p><ul><li>The Ohio statewide travel demand model is a mature activitiy-based
      model.</li><li>The new process expands the modeling source pool from the statewide
      model to also include Ohio MPO models including the 3C models (Cincinnati, Columbus
      and Cleveland) and the smaller OMS (Ohio Medium Small) models.</li><li>The TREDIS
      software calculates the economic impacts, benefits and costs of proposed projects,
      programs and policies.</li></ul><p>The results of the process resulted in:</p><ul><li>A
      more transparent and explainable system which is used for important decision-making
      at the state level.</li><li>Results can be generated at the statewide, regional
      or county level.</li><li>The new software results are comparable to the old
      software results.</li></ul>

    various aspects of activity-based travel demand models (ABMs). It covers advanced
    modeling techniques beyond traditional logit models, including optimization, machine
    learning, and discrete choice models, addressing their motivations, obstacles,
    and practical applications in travel demand forecasting. The session also delves
    into the critical role of modeling activity/travel behavior of individuals serving
    dependent household members, focusing on its impact on activity scheduling and
    intra-household interactions. Furthermore, it examines the importance of evaluating
    microsimulation variability in ABMs, comparing different statistical approaches
    (Monte-Carlo with uncontrolled/fixed random numbers and Random Utility Simulation
    with fixed seed) to understand their impact on model properties and sensitivity
    to input changes. Finally, the session presents a study on how public transport
    accessibility influences individual activity patterns, using real-world transit
    card data to provide empirical evidence for urban planning and transportation

    SessionTitle: Analysis of dependent-serving activity/travel behavior
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: <p class="MsoNormal">The objective of this study is to analyze the
      activity/travel behavior of persons serving dependent members of a household.
      These interactions are important to incorporate in activity-based travel demand
      modeling because of their impact on activity scheduling and travel behavior.
      Activity generation and scheduling is one of the most critical and challenging
      components of activity-based travel models. The desire to fulfill activities
      generates travel demand. Activity scheduling is a function of activity type
      and intra-household interactions. Most of the activity/travel models focus on
      mandatory and discretionary activities. Mandatory activities include work and
      school activities. These activities are generally pre-planned with fixed locations.
      However, new emerging working models such as flexible work arrangements are
      also becoming popular. Discretionary activities include maintenance activities
      such as shopping and visiting a doctor; and leisure activities such as visiting
      friends and participating in sports. These activities have flexible schedules
      and change from day-to-day. Most activity/travel models focus on modeling mandatory
      and discretionary activities. A third category of activities which is often
      neglected in modeling is helping or serving a dependent household member. We
      use the term &lsquo;serve dependent activity&rsquo; for these types of activities.</p><p
      class="MsoNormal">A dependent is a person who is unable to undertake certain
      activities unassisted and/or cannot be left unattended due to factors such as
      age and disability. In some cases, decisions concerning dependents&rsquo; activity
      participation are also taken by independent family members. For example, in
      the case of young children, parents decide their activity participation (join
      a play group, enroll in daycare, etc.). In this study, we mainly focus on the
      activity behavior of young children as a critical use case. These activities
      involve supervision, chauffeuring, and joint participation in activities (e.g.,
      visiting a doctor). These activities are important to study because they largely
      impact the activity scheduling of independent household members and involve
      complex household interactions. Some serve dependent activities which are pre-planned
      can also be classified as mandatory activities. For example, activities such
      as daycare and evening school sports class have fixed schedules and locations.
      Supervision of serve dependents at home also impacts participation in other
      types of activities. Household members interact with each other to manage serve
      dependent activities. In this paper, we present activity behavior of serve dependents
      and its related household interactions. We also present a framework to model
      these activities and household interactions in an activity-based travel demand
      model i.e., Toronto Area Scheduling Model for Household Agents (TASHA) developed
      for the Toronto Area in Canada.</p>

    SessionTitle: Rolling the Dice with ABM - A systematic study of microsimulation
      variability
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p class="MsoNormal">Activity-based models (ABMs) in practice involve
      random numbers to convert probabilistic outcomes of the logit choice models
      into discrete individual choices.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It
      is important to evaluate the model properties with respect to the microsimulation
      variability and its impact on the sensitivity due to changes in model inputs
      should be well understood.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Microsimulation variability
      can be better understood by evaluating aggregate and disaggregate model elasticities
      against several important properties:</p><ul><li class="MsoNormal"><u>Repeatability</u>
      of the results with the same inputs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;
      </span></li><li class="MsoNormal"><u>Continuity</u> across the range of inputs
      from large differences to small differences.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;
      </span>At the aggregate level, continuity means that small changes in inputs
      result in small changes in aggregate shares.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;
      </span>At the disaggregate level, continuity means that small changes in inputs
      result in a small number of individual switches.</li><li class="MsoNormal"><u>Monotonicity</u>
      across the range of scenario inputs. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span
      style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span></li><li class="MsoNormal"><u>Comparability</u>
      that requires a stable difference between two scenarios across different random
      seeds.</li></ul><p class="MsoNormal">The properties exhibited by various microsimulation
      approaches will differ in important ways. Here, we provide a systematic evaluation
      of the detailed scenario responses resulting from application of three different
      statistical options used in choice modeling:</p><ul><li class="MsoNormal">Monte-Carlo
      with Uncontrolled Random Numbers (MCR).</li><li class="MsoNormal">Monte-Carlo
      with a fixed seed for each individual choice (MCF).</li><li class="MsoNormal">Random
      utility simulation with fixed seed (RUF) for each individual and choice alternative
      that are generated in advance and kept fixed across compared scenarios.</li></ul><p
      class="MsoNormal">The insights are first illustrated for a single choice dimension
      (one sub-model), and then for a sequence of interlinked sub-models. The results
      indicate that only RUF can ensure all desired properties (at both aggregate
      and disaggregate level) in the context of one sub-model while MCF can ensure
      only some of them (primarily at the aggregate level). Results indicate that
      MCR is the most volatile method that may violate any of the desired properties.<span
      style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="MsoNormal">Differences
      between the three microsimulation methods might appear minimal at the aggregate
      level when the scale of the simulation (number of affected individuals) and
      magnitude of differences between scenarios are large.<span style="mso-spacerun:
      yes;">&nbsp; </span>However, these differences become more prominent when considered
      against smaller samples on scenarios with minor changes in inputs. In the context
      of a sequence of interlinked sub-models, RUF choice method results in the least
      number of irrelevant changes in the model results due to a transportation policy
      and hence is the most stable out of the three choice methods.</p><p class="MsoNormal">All
      microsimulations for this presentation are performed using the Regional Person
      Travel Model for Edmonton modelling region.</p>'

    Description: <p class="MsoNormal">This presentation introduces an extended data
      model designed to support disaggregate Activity-Based Models (ABMs), enabling
      enhanced analysis of individual travel behavior across diverse transportation
      modes. The model extensions facilitate detailed path tracing and user profiling,
      offering planners and researchers a powerful framework for multimodal mobility
      insights.</p><p class="MsoNormal">A generalized relational data structure connects
      daily activity plans&mdash;tours and trips&mdash;with spatial and modal attributes,
      supporting advanced select link analysis and multimodal tour representation.
      These enhancements enable person-level analytics, such as income and age distribution
      across auto, transit, and active modes.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Comparative
      applications using CT-RAMP, ActivitySim, and DaySim demonstrate the model&rsquo;s
      flexibility in profiling transit rider characteristics, evaluating resource
      access, and assessing equity impacts. By integrating ABM outputs with network
      modeling tools like Visum, the framework supports robust scenario testing and
      policy evaluation.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This work highlights the potential
      of enriched ABM data structures to inform equitable, data-driven transportation
      planning and investment strategies.</p>

      Background</strong></p><p class="MsoNormal">Highway capacity expansion projects
      often highlight collision reduction as a benefit, traditionally quantified using
      crash modification factors (CMFs) based on specific improvements. However, this
      approach does not capture the potential increase in collisions resulting from
      induced demand &ndash; the phenomenon where increased road capacity leads to
      more driving and, consequently, greater exposure to crash risk. To address this
      gap, the Sacramento Area Council of Governments (SACOG) developed a collision
      prediction model (CPM) to estimate how many collisions a project or plan scenario
      may create or prevent based on how the scenario affects factors such as vehicle-miles
      traveled (VMT), transit activity, and land use.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Description
      of Abstract</strong></p><p class="MsoNormal">SACOG developed a collision prediction
      model (CPM) using its regional travel demand model and observed collision data
      to estimate how many collisions a project or plan scenario may create or prevent
      based on how the project affects key factors that influence collision risk such
      as vehicle-miles traveled (VMT), transit activity, and land use.</p><p class="MsoNormal">SACOG&rsquo;s
      CPM predicts collisions at a zonal level for 15,498 256-acre hexagonal zones
      covering the SACOG region using a Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) model.
      Key explanatory variables include VMT, job and population density, transit service
      density, miles of multi-lane roads, and number of high-speed intersections.
      These inputs all come from SACOG&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.sacog.org/planning/data-resource-center/travel-demand-model/travel-model-documentation">SACSIM
      travel demand model</a>. Notably, the CPM is comprised of 11 submodels whose
      variables and coefficients are specific to different road types (freeways versus
      arterials) and different built environment types (e.g., urban, suburban, rural,
      etc.). To train and test the CPM, we used six years (2014-2019) of geocoded
      collision data from UC Berkeley&rsquo;s Traffic Injury Management System (TIMS).
      We trained the model on years 2014-2016, then tested the model&rsquo;s predictions
      against years 2017-2019.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">The resulting CPM has
      been used on several test projects and demonstrates its usefulness as a complement
      to more traditional CMF-based analysis, giving practitioners insight into whether
      a project will have a net safety cost or benefit, as well as how costs and benefits
      are distributed across different communities.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Statement
      on Why Abstract is Noteworthy</strong></p><p class="MsoNormal">SACOG&rsquo;s
      CPM contributions to planning practice include:</p><ul><li class="MsoNormal">Enabling
      more comprehensive safety analysis that considers safety effects both at a project
      location and regional level.</li><li class="MsoNormal">Adding an equity component
      to safety analysis by comparing changes in collisions for environmental justice
      (EJ) areas versus non-EJ areas.</li><li class="MsoNormal">Enabling identification
      of &ldquo;hot spot&rdquo; zones where observed collision frequency is much higher
      than the CPM predicts.</li><li class="MsoNormal">Inspiring California DOT (Caltrans)

    SessionTitle: Enhancing Project-Level ABM Application by Asking the Right Questions
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Background to Problem</strong></p><p
      class="MsoNormal">Activity-based travel demand models (ABMs) provide a sophisticated
      framework for simulating individual travel behaviors and forecasting transportation
      demand. While ABMs are valuable for regional policy analysis, their application
      at the project level requires additional due diligence. The complexity of ABMs
      poses challenges in ensuring model results are appropriately scoped, interpreted,
      and refined for local-scale decision-making. Practitioners must navigate model
      selection, input refinement, and post-processing considerations to generate
      meaningful, reliable insights for transportation projects.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Description
      of Application</strong></p><p class="MsoNormal">This presentation explores a
      structured approach to applying SACSIM19, an ABM developed by the Sacramento
      Area Council of Governments (SACOG), at the project level. Through case studies,
      it identifies key questions practitioners should ask to enhance ABM effectiveness.<span
      style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 107%;"> </span>The first consideration
      is whether SACSIM19 is the appropriate tool, depending on project type, size,
      study area characteristics, and desired forecasting outputs. The study provides
      examples where SACSIM19&rsquo;s detailed structure added value and cases where
      simpler models were more appropriate to answer the questions being asked.</p><p
      class="MsoNormal">Effective use of SACSIM19 depends on proper scoping of the
      analysis. Decisions on subarea validation, full model versus assignment-only
      runs, the number of model runs, and parameter settings can significantly influence
      outcomes. Case studies illustrate how subarea validation affects volumes and
      how different model parameters such as convergence criteria and assignment iterations
      can impact vehicle miles traveled (VMT). The presentation explores how running
      the model multiple times reduces model noise due to stochastic elements variability.</p><p
      class="MsoNormal">Refining model inputs is essential for reliable forecasting.
      This presentation explores how SACSIM19&rsquo;s population synthesis process,
      which includes multi-resolution land use inputs, are affected by the buffering
      of accessibility metrics. External gateway travel estimates require additional
      care to consider how visitor travel behavior is modeled in an ABM structure.</p><p
      class="MsoNormal">Post-processing is key for extracting actionable insights.
      ABMs provide a substantial amount of data that can be used for project level
      analysis, such as intersection-level volumes, but require post-processing (such
      as volume difference method) and reasonability checks to ensure appropriate
      use.</p><p class="MsoNormal">By understanding the model&rsquo;s capabilities,
      limitations, and necessary adjustments, this study shows how practitioners can
      ensure ABMs deliver valuable insights to support informed decision-making.</p><p
      class="MsoNormal"><strong>Statement on Why Application is Noteworthy</strong></p><p
      class="MsoNormal">This study offers a practical framework for applying ABMs
      at a project level, helping transportation planners refine model use for localized
      decision-making. The insights from SACSIM19 case studies provide a replicable
      methodology for improving project-level ABM applications, making this study
      valuable for agencies, model practitioners, and transportation planners looking
      to maximize the utility of ABMs.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Project Status</strong></p><p

      presentation evaluates MPO TDMs in California, focusing on their practical application
      for project-level analysis. To investigate potential challenges, a statewide
      survey was conducted, gathering responses from 25 out of 44 MPOs and RTPAs regarding
      model ownership, data availability, and calibration practices. Additionally,
      interviews with 14 MPOs and RTPAs were conducted to examine model structures,
      post-pandemic adjustments, induced VMT methodologies, and validation procedures.
      A technical review of six major MPO models assessed model documentation, calibration,
      transparency, and usability for project-level applications. Lastly, a project-level
      review of four Caltrans projects was conducted, incorporating feedback from
      Caltrans project managers to identify project-level implementation challenges.</span></p><p
      class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span
      lang="en-UM">Findings indicate that while MPO models offer broad application
      potential, the &ldquo;off-the-shelf&rdquo; models are often not directly suitable
      for project-level analysis without significant modifications. Key issues include
      inconsistencies in scenario development, stochastic variability in activity-based
      models (ABMs), and insufficient model sensitivity to project-specific changes.
      While most regional models undergo calibration and validation, many lack standardized
      methodologies for sensitivity testing, benchmark validation, and induced VMT
      estimation. ABMs, though well-suited for analyzing regional policy impacts,
      often require extensive adjustments for project-level applications, making them
      less practical without additional due diligence. Additionally, most models lack
      sufficient feedback mechanisms to generate reasonable induced VMT estimates
      for project-level anaysis. The review of Caltrans projects revealed limited
      documentation of project-specific modeling considerations and highlighted several
      concerns related to model applicability.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:
      justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;"><span lang="en-UM">Through interviews
      with MPOs, RTPAs, and Caltrans project managers, this study examines the challenges
      of applying TDMs for project-level analysis from multiple perspectives. By identifying
      these gaps and challenges, this project recommends establishing standardized
      modeling guidelines in collaboration with Caltrans, MPOs, and RTPAs. Developing
      a rigorous model review process, including a structured checklist for project
      applications, will improve transparency and consistency. Providing technical
      guidance on project documentation and scenario development will help ensure
      that model modifications and assumptions are properly documented and reviewed.</span></p>'

    SessionTitle: 'Ohio Planning Applications: Information-Forward'
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Abstract Background</strong></p><p
      class="MsoNormal">The development of a fully customized travel demand model
      designed to address specific applications can be both costly and time consuming.
      The Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) recently conducted two separate
      and distinct planning studies that managed to pivot from the existing statewide
      model: planning for the 2024 eclipse and a strategic statewide transportation
      analysis. By focusing on information delivery, highly valuable support can be
      delivered to decision-makers using existing resources at reduced costs.</p><p
      class="MsoNormal"><strong>Description of Abstract</strong></p><p class="MsoNormal">Two
      major planning efforts have recently relied on the Ohio Statewide Travel Demand
      Model: a statewide transportation analysis, and the planning for the April 8,
      2024 total solar eclipse, which occurred with a path of totality spanning from
      Maine to Texas. To better prepare for the atypical traffic conditions expected
      to occur on the eclipse day, the Ohio Department of Transportation developed
      an eclipse event tool using ODOT&rsquo;s statewide transportation model. To
      make the changes to the statewide model that were necessary to forecast eclipse-day
      travel demand, ODOT relied on observed data from the 2017 eclipse, which crossed
      over Kentucky and Tennessee, thus providing an opportunity to observe how travelers
      altered their travel patterns in an area not too far from Ohio. Traffic exiting
      these areas saw atypical increases at times-of-day inconsistent with normal
      peaking characteristics leading to high levels of congestion that disrupted
      traffic at many locations. This presentation will discuss how the observed data
      were used to adjust the Ohio statewide model to reflect anticipated eclipse
      day traffic.&nbsp; Additionally, accounting for the adjustments to trip lengths
      to reflect Ohio&rsquo;s particular travel patterns and the methods used to assign
      traffic at hourly intervals will be discussed.&nbsp; Emphasis will be given
      to how agency partners throughout Ohio were introduced to the outputs generated
      by the Eclipse tool.&nbsp; For the Strategic Transportation and Development
      Analysis, the state developed three population forecasts and the statewide model
      was used to determine what highway facilities would potentially be stressed
      in the future, either from inherent population growth, or if a major economic
      development initiative occurred in one of the sites throughout the state specifically
      identified for its ability to accommodate development.&nbsp; Each economic region
      of the state was analyzed to determine where the highest uncertainties were
      in regard to the resiliency of the transportation system and its ability to
      meet future needs.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Statement of Why Abstract
      is Noteworthy</strong></p><p class="MsoNormal">This work is notable because
      it demonstrates how two very different sets of tools that pivot from a central
      model and focus on information delivery were developed to create highly relevant
      information to decision makers in a short amount of time. Once the tools were
      in place, we were able to evaluate and create layers of information to inform
      STDA priorities in a data driven method and for Eclipse able to answer questions
      on how to prepare and move people for a once in a lifetime event.&nbsp;</p>'

    SessionTitle: Congestion Pricing Analysis and Performance Metrics
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Background to Problem</strong></p><p
      class="MsoNormal">Following the recent implementation of congestion pricing
      in New York City, various other cities that have explored congestion pricing
      strategies have shown renewed interest. Notably, congestion pricing is one of
      the various strategies adopted in Southern California and the San Francisco
      Bay Area to help achieve regional sustainability goals. The impact of these
      strategies on local and regional trip making, vehicle-miles traveled and greenhouse
      gas reductions, among other impacts, have been assessed with regional travel
      demand models (RTDMs). This presentation will outline an essential modification
      required to obtain useful measures of user benefits from a RTDM, based on our
      experience in analyzing such projects.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Description
      of Application</strong></p><p class="MsoNormal">When evaluating alternatives
      in a congestion pricing study, it is important to consider not only basic metrics
      such as VMT changes, VHT changes, and delay changes but also the differential
      impact of tolls and travel time improvements on various population segments.
      While dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) tools are useful to simulate the traffic
      dynamics under a road pricing regime, it can be challenging to use them at a
      regional scale to understand the cost and benefits at an individual (traveler)
      level. For this reason, RTDMs are still used widely to study congestion pricing
      projects. Off-the shelf RTDMS typically generate one set of average skims for
      each time period and vehicle class. While these average skims are sufficient
      for predicting demand, they are not particularly useful for reporting costs
      and benefits at an individual level. These skims typically underrepresent the
      congestion reduction benefits. Moreover, using these average skims to report
      differences in the level-of-service for different population segments suggests
      nearly identical costs and benefits to different segments of the society, which
      need not be the case as individuals with lower value-of-time (VOT) can divert
      to other routes, modes and/or time periods <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>to
      avoid/reduce their travel cost. For this project we post-processed the standard
      RTDM model outputs to create skims that were segmented by VOT values, and used
      those skims to compute metrics such as travel time improvements, toll amount
      paid, changes in job accessibility for specific individuals, and other metrics.
      Once these individual metrics are appropriately computed based on these VOT
      skims, the results are summarized at a higher level of aggregation, such as
      by household income groupings or equity focus community areas. In this presentation,
      we will showcase the various metrics and insights produced using this approach.
      In addition to this, we will also present the details of the other modifications
      made to the model to use distributed VOT in mode choice and assignment, as has
      been recommended by the Strategic Highway Research Program.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Statement
      on Why Abstract is Noteworthy</strong></p><p class="MsoNormal">With growing
      interest in congestion pricing as an areawide or regional strategy, RTDMs will
      continue to be used to assess user benefits and impacts, at least until dynamic
      traffic assignment tools can be deployed at the scale of medium and large regions
      and integrated with demand models. This presentation describes a methodology
      for specifying RTDMs for use in congestion pricing applications that extends
      SHRP guidance on this topic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p><p><strong><span

    SessionTitle: Developing an Induced Travel Assessment Framework
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: left;" align="left">A
      project for the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) is underway
      to develop an induced demand assessment framework and a guide to help Departments
      of Transportation (DOT) to apply framework to policy and planning analysis.<span
      style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The research objectives include (1)
      defining induced demand; (2) gathering and evaluating data needed to develop
      the assessment framework; (3) piloting, validating, and testing the assessment
      framework; and (4) communicating findings from the framework to build consensus.</p><p
      class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: left;" align="left">In contrast to analysis
      of aggregate-level data, the research team is using a &ldquo;case study&rdquo;
      approach to evaluate major highway capacity and operations improvement projects
      across different geographic contexts. This approach involves examining data
      sources specific and appropriate to each project context.<span style="mso-spacerun:
      yes;">&nbsp; </span>The case studies will provide a comprehensive view of the
      elements influencing high or low induced demand response as a function of project
      scope.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The case study locations
      will be selected using four key criteria: 1) geographic/contextual diversity;
      2) projects completed within the past 5 to 10 years; 3) likely availability
      of suitable data; and 4) willingness of the state DOT to assist with data collection.</p><p
      class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: left;" align="left">The research team
      has completed an exhaustive literature review, covering over 25 years of studies
      and developed a working definition of induced travel, which may be simply stated
      as &ldquo;changes in the amount and nature of travel resulting from changes
      in the transportation system.&rdquo;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;
      </span>We note that induced travel has several components, including shifts
      in route, mode, time of day, and trip destination, as well as changes in the
      number of trips and land use development impacts.<span style="mso-spacerun:
      yes;">&nbsp; </span>However, these components are not always easy to distinguish
      within the context of observed data.</p><p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align:
      left;" align="left">The literature review reveals some areas of broad consensus
      and the ongoing evolution of understanding regarding induced travel as research
      has advanced over the years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Several
      gaps in the existing research have been identified, including how induced travel
      effects may vary within different project contexts, how travel speeds affect
      travel volumes, how the various components of travel change contribute to overall
      observed induced travel effects, the degree to which induced travel applies
      to commercial vehicle travel, and the degree to which the underlying components
      of induced travel are changing over time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;
      </span>The research team is working on filling these research gaps as possible.</p><p
      class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: left;" align="left">At the time of the
      presentation, the research team will have nearly completed the analysis of relevant
      data and will be close to proposing specific case study locations to the project
      panel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The case study approach
      will be fully delineated, and the analysis methods will have been defined.<span
      style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The presentation will be designed to
      solicit input from the planning and modeling communities; this will help greatly
      to inform the case study work and the guidance developed over the following
      year.</p>'

    SessionTitle: 'Estimating Induced VMT: Empirical Tools versus Trip and Activity
      Based Travel Demand Models'
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: "<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">In response\
      \ to Senate Bill 743 (Steinberg, 2013), and the subsequent decision by the state\
      \ to apply the legislation statewide, and the guidance issued by the Governor&rsquo;s\
      \ Office of Planning and Research, the California Department of Transportation\
      \ (Caltrans) determined that Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) was the metric for\
      \ determining transportation impacts of capacity increasing projects on the\
      \ state highway system (SHS). This paper examines methodologies for assessing\
      \ induced Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) in the context of California&rsquo;s\
      \ SB 743 policy.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">The\
      \ Caltrans Transportation Analysis Framework (TAF) outlines two approaches for\
      \ estimating induced travel: an empirical method employing the National Center\
      \ for Sustainable Transportation (NCST) Induced Travel Calculator and a regional\
      \ or local travel demand model. The NCST Calculator quantifies long<span style=\"\
      font-family: 'Cambria Math',serif; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Cambria Math';\">\u2010\
      </span>term induced travel by applying long-term average elasticities based\
      \ on empirical (before-after) studies from national databases and Caltrans-endorsed\
      \ research. The NCST calculator relies on the addition of lane miles but does\
      \ not directly account for any VMT change associated with population and employment\
      \ growth, change in demographic or socioeconomic conditions, advances in transportation\
      \ technology or modes, etc. In contrast, the travel demand models model incorporates\
      \ diversion effects and changes in origin&ndash;destination patterns to capture\
      \ both short-term and, with current land use assumptions, long-term impacts\
      \ of highway capacity enhancements; however, it lacks sensitivity to the land\
      \ use response to network changes.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align:\
      \ justify;\">The long-term elasticities are inherently variable across projects,\
      \ corridors, and regions, and the NCST Calculator&rsquo;s reliance solely on\
      \ lane-mile additions may lead to estimation biases in corridors with unique\
      \ travel characteristics. Through a series of case studies in urban corridors,\
      \ this study compares VMT estimates from the NCST tool and an activity-based\
      \ model, and explores hybrid approaches for reconciling short- and long-term\
      \ induced travel effects in capacity-assessment projects. The findings underscore\
      \ the importance of considering corridor context and the inherent limitations\
      \ of each method when interpreting induced VMT estimates.</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"\

      ''Times New Roman''; mso-font-kerning: 0pt; mso-ligatures: none;">Demographic
      inputs (e.g., household population, group quarters population, households, and
      median household income) are essential for travel demand modeling. Traditionally,
      these models rely on Traffic Analysis Zone (TAZ)-level demographic data, which
      differs from standard Census Bureau geographic units such as blocks, block groups,
      and census tracts.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0in;

      Roman'',serif; mso-fareast-font-family: ''Times New Roman''; mso-font-kerning:
      0pt; mso-ligatures: none;">With the Census Transportation Planning Products
      (CTPP) program discontinuing demographic data at the TAZ level, Census Block
      Groups will now serve as the smallest geography for demographic data. This shift
      presents significant challenges for established travel demand models, which
      depend on TAZ-level inputs. Transitioning to a Census Block Group-based system
      requires substantial time, effort, and cost to update existing models.</span></p><p
      class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: normal;"><span style="font-size:

      New Roman''; mso-font-kerning: 0pt; mso-ligatures: none;">To address this, we
      propose a crosswalk methodology that reallocates demographic data from Census
      Block Groups to TAZs. Unlike traditional area-based allocation methods, which
      assume uniform population distribution, our approach uses geocoded address point
      data. This technique proportionally distributes demographics based on actual
      residential housing, group quarters, and business locations, ensuring greater
      accuracy in representing population distribution within each TAZ.</span></p><p

      New Roman''; mso-font-kerning: 0pt; mso-ligatures: none;">Since demographics
      are a critical input for transportation models, an effective crosswalk mitigates
      disruptions from the CTPP change while maintaining model accuracy. This paper
      presents the methodology, demonstrating how Census Block Group data can be seamlessly
      integrated into TAZ-based travel demand models, ensuring continuity in planning
      and decision-making.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0in;

    Description: '<p dir="ltr">Reproducibility is fundamental to the scientific process,
      allowing researchers and practitioners to build upon existing work, validate
      findings, and accelerate innovation. In transportation research, the inability
      to easily reproduce prior studies hinders progress, wasting valuable time and
      resources. Researchers often struggle to replicate results due to missing code,
      incomplete data, inadequate documentation, or incompatible computational environments.
      Despite the recognized importance of reproducibility, a comprehensive, quantitative
      assessment of its state within the transportation research domain is lacking.
      This deficiency limits the ability to track progress, identify best practices,
      and implement effective interventions to improve reproducibility.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p
      dir="ltr">This research addresses this critical gap by developing and applying
      a scalable, automated methodology to measure the availability of features associated
      with reproducibility in transportation research publications. We define a set
      of key features that indicate the potential for reproducibility, including:
      code availability, data availability, completeness of setup instructions, presence
      of data dictionaries, use of interactive notebooks, level of code documentation,
      and informativeness of variable names.</p><p dir="ltr">A significant challenge
      in assessing these features is the heterogeneity of software, programming language,
      and types of data used in transportation research, encompassing various programming
      languages and specialized software packages without any standard to encode this
      information. To overcome this, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate
      tailored scripts for feature extraction from published papers and diverse codebases.
      These LLM-generated scripts are carefully reviewed and validated by the research
      team to ensure accuracy.</p><p dir="ltr">Using this approach, we analyze a corpus
      of over 10,000 papers published between 2019 and 2024 in leading transportation
      journals, specifically Transportation Research Parts A-F and Interdisciplinary
      Perspectives. We will present a detailed analysis of code and data availability
      , the prevalence of all defined reproducibility features, temporal trends in
      reproducibility practices, and variations across different journals and research
      subfields within transportation.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p dir="ltr">This
      research directly addresses the MOMO 2025 "Connect" theme by bridging the gap
      between academic research and planning practices to improve the reproducibility
      of transportation research. The findings will empower journal editors, funding
      agencies, researchers, and practitioners to promote better reproducibility practices.
      The automated methodology developed in this work offers a scalable solution
      for ongoing monitoring of reproducibility, potentially enabling the integration
      of automated reproducibility metrics into journal submission systems. For instance,
      leveraging Elsevier''s API, we demonstrate a practical pathway to extract these
      metrics directly from publication in the Transportation Research journal series.
      This initiative will foster a culture of transparency and collaboration within
      the transportation research community, ultimately leading to more robust, reliable,
      and impactful research that can better inform transportation planning and policy
      decisions. The open-source code and derived data will be made publicly available
      on github, further connecting researchers and facilitating the adoption of best
      practices.</p>'

    SessionTitle: Evolution of travel behavior in the Phoenix, AZ metropolitan region
      from 2008 to 2024 and implications for travel model calibration
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p class="MsoNormal">The presentation describes the recent update
      of the regional Activity-Based travel Model (ABM) of the Maricopa Association
      of Governments (MAG) with the new Household Travel Survey (HTS) and other available
      sources of information.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The MAG
      ABM was originally developed based on HTS 2008.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;
      </span>It was subsequently updated based on HTS 2017, and now with HTS 2024.<span
      style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Having three detailed HTSs for three
      different years and utilizing them for ABM calibration provided a unique basis
      for analysis of the changes in travel behavior. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>This
      also led us to certain conclusions on how the entire process of periodic model
      recalibrations can be better structured.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;
      </span>The presentation has two focus points:</p><p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst"

      style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>We compare detailed results &ndash;
      from three surveys across multiple travel dimensions &ndash; used as targets
      for model calibration while controlling for a wide set of socio-economic parameters.<span
      style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Those include car ownership, commuting
      &amp; telecommuting characteristics, daily activity pattern generation, tour
      structures, mode choice, time-of-day distributions, etc.<span style="mso-spacerun:
      yes;">&nbsp; </span>Special emphasis is given to the post-pandemic trends of
      more frequent telecommuting, transit-averse behavior, interest in active modes,

      for ABM recalibration</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The
      paper discusses how HTS and other sources of information (such as traffic counts,
      transit on-board survey, big data, and additional data sources) were integrated
      in the ABM update.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>It substantiates
      which sub-models require a complete re-estimation from scratch and which ones
      can be &ldquo;boosted&rdquo; by a partial recalibration while still preserving
      the main historical patterns (essentially combining data from different HTSs
      for model calibration).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>After
      a revision of each sub-model with the HTS data, the entire model system is validated
      using traffic counts and big data.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>At
      this point a decision is made on whether an additional adjustment of model parameters
      may be needed. These additional adjustments are less straightforward compared
      to sub-model calibration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The
      presentation provides practical templates for typical steps at this stage.<span
      style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>They include systematic analysis of
      the discrepancies between traffic counts and/or big data, identification of
      the sub-models and specific parameters as the best candidates for adjustment,
      iterative update of parameters, etc.</p><p><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height:

      forecasting model up-to-date and will stimulate a useful discussion at the conference.<span
      style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Rather than a major update of the travel
      model every 5-10 years, we envision a systematic process of &ldquo;boosting&rdquo;
      on a significantly shorter time frame, utilizing various available sources of

    SessionTitle: 'Keeping It Simple: Project Traffic Dashboard Using MS Excel'
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: <p><strong>Background</strong></p><p>Several third-party big data
      analytic vendors, such as StreetLight, Replica, INRIX, and AirSage, provide
      detailed insights into corridor traffic characteristics, including origin-destination
      flow, network performance, trip characteristics, and turning movement counts.
      MPOs, DOTs, consultants, and general users of these data sources have created
      various applications to summarize and visualize this data. This presentation
      describes one such dashboard created in MS Excel with a Python backend for a
      corridor improvement project on Route 17 in New York. The dashboard is used
      by the agency to identify potential locations for congestion relief measures
      and to calibrate the traffic microsimulation model.</p><p><strong>Description
      of Application</strong></p><p>The NYSDOT Route 17 Mobility &amp; Access Improvements
      Project in Orange and Sullivan Counties, New York, aims to address operational
      and safety deficiencies resulting from non-standard and non-conforming geometric
      design elements. The project seeks to achieve interstate standards and improve
      congestion-related travel times during peak periods. To support the project's
      needs and gain insights into seasonal variation and growth, big data analytics
      were employed to supplement field traffic data collected in May and June 2023.
      Three sets of travel metrics&mdash;travel times, traffic flow, and average trip
      speed through the corridor&mdash;from January 2022 to December 2024 were compiled
      from big data sources for the entire project corridor. Additionally, hourly
      travel time data for each Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Sunday throughout
      2023 was compiled to perform cluster analysis and calibrate the microsimulation
      model in accordance with the FHWA 2019 update to the Traffic Analysis Toolbox
      Volume III guidelines.</p><p>A Python-based software tool processed these analyses
      and collated the results into a user-friendly spreadsheet dashboard. This tool
      allows users to specify origin, destination, day of the week, season, and year
      to obtain detailed information on hourly travel time, average speed, and total
      origin-destination (OD) traffic. It also generates charts of seasonal travel
      time and OD traffic flow, along with 15-minute and hourly average speed heatmaps
      showing corridor conditions at different times of the day by season. These results
      helped analyze traffic operations and identify existing deficiencies in accommodating
      seasonal and diurnal traffic variations to inform potential improvements. Efforts
      are underway to make the Python software open-source for broader use in similar
      projects.</p><p><strong>Statement on Why Application is Noteworthy</strong></p><p>This
      work presents a simple framework for summarizing and reporting traffic characteristics
      from big data sources. The software developed to create the dashboard uses simple
      YAML and CSV files as parameters to read big data outputs, making it easy to
      apply to different projects. The dashboard itself is accessible to a wide audience
      with varying technical expertise due to its basis in simple Excel functions.
      Although the dashboard was developed using StreetLight data, it can be easily
      adapted to read data from other vendors.</p><p><strong>Project Status</strong></p><p>The
      application is complete, and the primary project for which this application
      was developed is currently ongoing.</p>

      Boston Region Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) released its regional
      travel demand model TDM23 for the general public in early 2024, which supports
      various research and project applications in the MPO. TDM23 has proven to be
      a robust travel demand model. However, generating ad hoc reports via Jupyter
      notebooks has required meticulous coding and fine-tuning, often demanding significant
      time investment to setup and maintain the data analytics and visualization environments,
      rather than focusing on analytical insights. To address these inefficiencies,
      a dedicated utility platform was developed to automate output processing. This
      platform allows users to bypass the cumbersome environment setup and concentrate
      on analyzing reports and map visualizations, whether for internal use or sharing
      with external stakeholders. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

      travel demand modeling, expanding access for a broader range of users and improving
      the efficiency of data delivery to the end user. This platform offers an innovative,
      open platform through a user-friendly portal with various utilities tailored
      to model application and research needs. It bridges the gap between model developers,
      users, and stakeholders with a centralized access point - utilities portal.
      Developers provide standardized code scripts, and the platform handles the technical
      complexities. Users can effortlessly navigate the portal, choose the tools they
      need, and perform analyses, with the platform delivering shareable results -

    SessionTitle: A Data-Driven Tool for Evaluating the Accessibility of Planned Transportation
      Projects
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: <p dir="ltr">A core purpose of the transportation system is to efficiently
      connect residents to destinations. Access to opportunities (ATO) measures how
      well people can reach essential needs such as jobs, schools, grocery stores,
      parks, and community centers by combining mobility and proximity analyses.</p><p
      dir="ltr">The Wasatch Front Regional Council (WFRC) has primarily measured ATO
      through travel demand model (TDM) outputs and developed web-based tools to explore
      regional accessibility. However, a faster, more flexible method was needed to
      complement the TDM approach. To address this, WFRC developed the ATO Impact
      Tool, built on ESRI's ArcGIS Network Analyst. This tool assesses the accessibility
      benefits of individual or small groups of road, transit, bike, and land-use
      projects. It does so by incorporating candidate projects into the baseline network,
      adjusting travel time assumptions, and recalculating distance-decayed travelsheds
      for over 3,000 traffic analysis zones (TAZs). The tool then quantifies changes
      in job and household accessibility, allowing comparisons between baseline and
      project scenarios at regional and local scales.</p><p dir="ltr">The ATO Impact
      Tool&rsquo;s results have been integrated into WFRC&rsquo;s Regional Transportation
      Plan (RTP) prioritization process. The tool generates an ATO metric that measures
      both how well residents can access jobs and how well employers can reach the
      labor force. These measures are scaled using the Region&rsquo;s jobs-per-household
      ratio, producing a composite score.</p><p dir="ltr">By identifying accessibility
      gaps, ATO analysis supports planning decisions, and includes summary metrics
      for underserved populations who may be less frequent users of&nbsp; personal
      vehicles to meet their travel needs. Designed for efficiency, the tool&rsquo;s
      analysis takes 20-30 minutes per project and can be applied beyond the WFRC
      planning area. While individual projects typically have a minor impact on regional
      ATO&mdash;less than 1%&mdash;they show meaningful variation at the local level.
      This allows for targeted planning and a better understanding of transportation
      equity across different populations.</p>

    SessionTitle: Dallas-Fort Worth High-Speed Transportation Connections Study
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><a style="color: rgb(0, 0,
      0);" href="The North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG), in cooperation
      with the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and Federal Transit Administration
      (FTA), is conducting engineering and environmental studies for high-speed passenger
      service between downtown Dallas and downtown Fort Worth, which spans a distance
      of approximately 31 miles. High-speed service between Dallas and Fort Worth
      would potentially connect to a separate high-speed passenger rail service being
      planned between Dallas and Houston, and high-speed passenger services planned
      to link Fort Worth to south Texas metropolitan areas. This study is evaluating
      high-speed alternatives in the Dallas-Arlington-Fort Worth corridor by analyzing
      potential alignments and technologies; follow-on operations and service planning
      will inform preliminary engineering and environmental documentation for high-speed
      passenger service. At a minimum, conventional, higher-speed, and high-speed
      passenger rail, as well as magnetic levitation (maglev) and emerging hyperloop
      technologies, are considered.  The project scope of work consists of two phases.
      Phase 1 (2020-2022) developed and evaluated a wide range of high-speed technology
      and alignment alternatives.  The result of Phase 1 was a limited number of alignments
      and one high-speed technology to be refined and further evaluated in Phase 2.
      These efforts will be documented through the National Environmental Policy Act
      (NEPA) process.  In Phase 1, 43 alignments and five technologies were evaluated
      through three levels of screening analyses. To help inform Levels 2 and 3 of
      the screening analysis, a travel demand investigation evaluated the potential
      demand for high-speed service based on premium service characteristics, connectivity
      to other high-speed corridors, regional connectivity, socio-economic information,
      and travel behavior.  The intent of the travel demand analysis in Phase 1 was
      to provide a sufficient level of detail to differentiate between modes and alignments
      and was not to serve as a ridership estimation. In Phase 1, various travel demand
      scenarios based on technologies/modes, number of stations, and connectivity
      were developed to determine the effect of these variables on demand. Within
      each scenario, three different trip types are defined to make up the forecasted
      travel demand: intra-regional, intercity, and external to external trips.  Intra-regional
      trips were estimated using the Dallas-Fort Worth Regional Travel Demand Model
      (RTM), which NCTCOG developed and maintains. Intercity and external to external
      trips were estimated with support from previous forecasting efforts by others.
      Special events, induced demand, and latent demand were considered in forecasting

      (comprising 4.7 million words) from the EPA&rsquo;s docket on greenhouse gas
      standards for heavy-duty vehicles. Our analysis quantifies topic and sentiment
      across themes such as infrastructure readiness, costs, regulation, climate change,
      and public health, revealing systematic differences across stakeholder groups.
      For example, trucking-affiliated businesses expressed negative sentiment about
      costs and feasibility, while nonprofits and individuals highlighted climate

      find that industry stakeholders consistently received attention regardless of

      even when presenting technically strong input. Moreover, EPA devoted greater
      attention to comments focused on compliance costs than to those emphasizing
      public health or climate impacts. This inequitable weighting of stakeholder

    SessionTitle: Using Travel Demand Model as a Conflict Resolution Tool
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Abstract Background</strong></p><p
      class="MsoNormal">In most parts of the country, transportation investments are
      heavily skewed towards roadways. The tools developed to guide the decision-making
      process typically include a travel demand model, which are often focused on
      roadway calibration. This leads to the belief in certain traditional DOTs that
      &lsquo;widening&rsquo; and &lsquo;new roadways&rsquo; are the only solutions
      to improving mobility and reducing congestion. This presentation shows the modeled
      impacts of removing widening projects from the Metropolitan Transportation Plan
      (MTP) of Triangle West Transportation Planning Organization (TWTPO) in North
      Carolina and makes a case for a more balanced approach when determining when
      to consider widening.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Project level planning in North
      Carolina is done with the assumption that changes on a particular corridor will
      impact only that corridor, and not the regional system Many agencies believe
      the traffic studies assume that the demand on a given roadway corridor will
      remain constant no matter the capacity of the roadway. Certain agencies&rsquo;
      outlook is completely opposite &ndash; that if roadway widenings are not provided,
      the demand will disappear or take other forms of transport. Our analysis suggests
      that the reality lies somewhere between these two positions, and so do the solutions.
      Neither &lsquo;widening&rsquo; nor &lsquo;not-widening&rsquo; is always the
      answer, and that policy choice often is the issue to be tackled.<span style="mso-spacerun:
      yes;">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal">The TWTPO removed many previously
      planned road widenings in their 2050 MTP assumption behind the removal of widening
      projects was that the trips will use other arterial and local roads for shorter
      trips, and some congestion will necessitate mode-shift towards non-motorized
      modes and transit. NCDOT wanted to understand the impacts of this decision to
      be able to have an informed negotiation during the ongoing 2055 MTP discussions.&nbsp;</p><p
      class="MsoNormal">Our analysis was not limited to standard congestion metrics.
      It also included accessibility of population and employment, transit ridership
      change, change in aggregate production and attraction, aggregate delay, cost
      of delay, and basic calculations of return on <a style="mso-comment-reference:
      HL_2; mso-comment-date: 20250221T1723; mso-comment-done: yes;">investment</a>.
      This helped NCDOT understand how removing widenings on each individual project
      will impact overall system level travel metrics and provide them with enough
      information to have a discussion with TWTPO to come to a common understanding
      regarding road-widening in the upcoming 2055 MTP.&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal">The

      data-darkreader-inline-color="" data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor="">Over the past
      few decades, transportation has been influenced by various factors, including
      rapid technological advances, changes in demographics, changes in the public&rsquo;s
      values and priorities, and ongoing changes in the economy and climate. These
      forces have shaped the travel choices available, and how Americans travel and
      allocate time and money to different activities as they navigate their day-to-day
      lives. To better understand the evolving transportation landscape and changing
      mobility patterns, this effort leverages data from multiple key national surveys:
      the American Community Survey (ACS), the American Time Use Survey (ATUS), and
      the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE), complemented by other transportation data
      sources and statistics. The analysis provides a comprehensive overview of mobility
      trends, focusing on travel metrics such as trip frequency, mode usage, vehicle
      miles traveled (VMT), commuting patterns, work arrangements, time use across
      various trip purposes, and household expenditures on transportation. The findings
      reveal declines in overall trip-making, particularly for commuting and shopping
      trips, along with a significant increase in telework &ndash; which is a pre-COVID
      trend amplified by the pandemic. While travel patterns have begun to stabilize
      in the post-pandemic period, some behavioral shifts remain. Overall trip-making
      has not returned to pre-pandemic levels, and the fraction of individuals reporting
      zero trips remains considerably higher than in the pre-COVID period. Social
      and recreational travel is showing signs of recovery, but public transportation
      use remains subdued, and non-motorized modes like walking and biking have also
      declined. On the other hand, micromobility options, such as e-bikes and e-scooters,
      are gaining popularity, and telework continues to influence travel behavior.
      These trends have important implications for transportation planning in a &ldquo;new
      normal&rdquo; era as the spatio-temporal patterns of travel are considerably
      different in the post-COVID period. Future infrastructure investments will need
      to accommodate more flexible and diverse travel patterns, moving beyond a commuting-centric
      operational model. Transportation planning practices and forecasts that drive
      policy decisions and investments must be updated using contemporary data that
      reflects the latest behaviors, choices, and preferences so that future mobility
      solutions and technologies meet the evolving needs of residents and businesses.
      This presentation will provide a comprehensive overview of two decades of trends
      with a discussion of the implications of these trends for policy planning and
      modeling in the future.</span></p>'

    SessionTitle: "Evaluating Strategies to Improve Travel Survey Representativeness:\
      \ Weighting and Convenience Sampling in Met Council\u2019s 2021-2022 Travel\
      \ Behavior Inventory"
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p class="MsoNormal">Recruiting respondents from key subregions
      and population subgroups for travel surveys is increasingly challenging, leading
      to concerns about data representativeness. Recent U.S. regional household travel
      surveys (HTS) have tested various strategies to mitigate low and differential
      nonresponse. This paper evaluates key strategies addressing unit nonresponse,
      including disproportionate stratification (oversampling), incentives, convenience
      (multimethod) sampling, and weighting. Using the total survey error paradigm,
      we propose an analytic framework to assess how these strategies impact representativeness
      in travel behavior data. We illustrate this approach with data from Metropolitan
      Council&rsquo;s 2021&ndash;2022 Travel Behavior Inventory (TBI), which covers
      the Minneapolis&ndash;St. Paul region.</p><p class="MsoNormal">First, we review
      common barriers to evaluating travel survey representativeness. Recent state-of-practice
      syntheses highlight that self-selection in travel behaviors, beyond just differences
      in demographic distributions, is a critical yet underexamined concern. However,
      standard indicators such as response rates and socioeconomic distributions do
      not evaluate this nonresponse bias directly. Moreover, the unique sample designs
      and post-survey adjustments of regional travel surveys make it difficult to
      generalize across studies or identify which strategies improve representativeness.
      Evaluation becomes even more challenging when multiple approaches are used simultaneously.
      Finally, there are numerous travel survey behaviors (trip rates, mode choice,
      etc.) and corresponding statistics (means, proportions, associations, regression
      coefficients etc.) for which it is critical to have low nonresponse bias, but
      different MPOs may prioritize evaluating and reducing bias on different behaviors
      and statistics.</p><p class="MsoNormal">To address these challenges, we develop
      a framework that:</p><ol style="margin-top: 0in;" start="1" type="1"><li class="MsoNormal"
      style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;">Facilitates evaluation
      of nonresponse bias on travel behavior measures, rather than just SED representativeness.</li><li
      class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;">Can
      be applied without requiring additional data collection or experimental design
      changes.</li><li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops:
      list .5in;">Can be adapted to various survey designs and regions.</li></ol><p
      class="MsoNormal">Then, we use the Metropolitan Council&rsquo;s TBI data to
      demonstrate how differential nonresponse introduces bias in socioeconomic distributions
      and vehicle ownership rates. We then quantify how convenience sampling and weighting
      adjustments influence both bias and precision in travel behavior estimates.
      Our findings offer insights into improving survey representativeness and reliability,
      with implications for future survey designs. We conclude by discussing how this
      framework can be extended to evaluate other response-enhancement strategies
      and to improve the connection between survey methods, data quality, and transportation
      planning decisions.</p>'

    SessionTitle: 'Advancing Household Travel Surveys: Innovations in Survey Instruments,
      Recruitment, and Big Data Integration'
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: <p class="MsoNormal">Household Travel Surveys (HTS) remain a critical
      tool for understanding travel behavior and informing transportation planning.
      However, evolving technologies, shifting mobility patterns, and recruitment
      challenges necessitate continuous adaptation. This study, conducted by Cambridge
      Systematic (CS) for the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC),
      synthesizes insights from recent HTS efforts across the United States, drawing
      from survey documentation and interviews with Metropolitan Planning Organizations
      (MPOs) representing diverse methodological approaches and regional characteristics.</p><p
      class="MsoNormal">Findings highlight the widespread transition to online surveys
      and smartphone applications, which have largely replaced traditional paper surveys
      due to their ability to streamline response collection and validate data in
      real time. GPS-enabled mobile apps have significantly improved trip reporting
      accuracy by passively capturing travel data, mitigating recall bias, and reducing
      respondent burden. While app-based surveys enhance data completeness and quality,
      disparities in digital access and user preferences necessitate multi-modal survey
      options, including web-based and phone interviews, to ensure broad participation.
      Agencies employing app-based methods have observed higher trip counts and more
      reliable travel diaries, although limitations remain in willingness to participate
      and interpreting certain activities, such as transit transfers and short stops.</p><p
      class="MsoNormal">Recruitment strategies remain centered on address-based sampling
      (ABS) as the standard for ensuring representative participant selection, with
      some MPOs supplementing ABS with convenience sampling to increase participation
      among underrepresented groups. Agencies have used social media, community partnerships,
      and school district collaborations to engage the general and especially hard-to-reach
      populations. Targeted outreach, bilingual materials, and trusted community organizations
      have helped improve representation, though response rates remain a challenge.
      Incentive structures have also evolved, with differential incentives based on
      response method, household size, and survey duration proving effective in encouraging
      participation while balancing cost considerations.</p><p class="MsoNormal">In
      response to changing travel behaviors, many agencies have refined their survey
      instruments to capture emerging mobility trends, including transportation network
      companies (TNCs), micromobility, e-commerce deliveries, and hybrid work patterns.
      Capturing these shifts is essential for accurate demand forecasting and policy
      development. Additionally, MPOs are increasingly supplementing HTS data with
      big data sources such as LOCUS, Streetlight, and INRIX to validate travel patterns,
      analyze visitor trips, and improve model calibration. While these sources provide
      valuable insights beyond traditional household samples, concerns persist regarding
      data transparency, biases, and the need for statistical rigor in their integration.
      Some agencies have taken steps to develop open-source tools to enhance the reliability
      and equity of data use.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This study provides a comprehensive
      overview of contemporary HTS methodologies, emphasizing advancements in survey
      instruments, recruitment strategies, and data integration. The findings offer
      valuable guidance for agencies seeking to improve survey efficiency, enhance
      data quality, and ensure equitable representation in future HTS efforts.</p>

    SessionTitle: Fully Bayesian Imputation for Transit Panel Survey Data
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: <div><div><strong>Background</strong></div><div>In the United States,
      transit agencies rely on semi-regular surveys of their passengers in order to
      track important metrics such as individual ridership frequency and satisfaction
      with the service. Recently, more agencies have collected repeated observations
      of the same people ("panel data") in order to track how individuals' behaviors
      and satisfaction change over time. Despite important efforts to improve representativeness
      of these samples, the data sets are often plagued by the well-known issues of
      missing data and selection bias. Panel data present an especially tricky challenge
      -- respondents can come and go from the panel, leaving gaps in their trajectories
      of arbitrary length and frequency. The issue is compounded when this come-and-go
      behavior is systematically related to demographics, satisfaction, transit experiences,
      or all of the above. While these data sets are still valuable for many of the
      goals of the agencies collecting them, statistical corrections and data imputation
      are required for reliable and robust statistical estimates (and predictions)
      that translate into actionable mobility policy.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong>Present
      work</strong></div><div><div><div>Many existing imputation efforts in transportation
      focus on passively collected data.</div><div>For example, there is a large body
      of work on imputing trip purpose and travel mode from cell phone trace data.&nbsp;In
      this study, we use simulated panel data with different levels of attrition from
      the panel to demonstrate the pitfalls of making inferences and predictions on
      these types of data sets.&nbsp;A figure showing these phenomena with simulated
      data is attached to the submission.&nbsp;Then, we present a framework for imputing
      satisfaction data from individuals who miss certain waves.&nbsp;This Bayesian
      model incorporates sociodemographic information, travel mode, satisfaction values
      from previous waves, and a gaussian process for spatial covariance to jointly
      impute missing values and estimate the effects of predictor variables.&nbsp;The
      fully Bayesian approach provides strong uncertainty quantification -- imputed
      values come with full probability distributions which automatically propagate
      into the inferences and predictions made by the model.&nbsp;It also handles
      imputation of missing values from multiple variables at the same time, without
      requiring a separate model for each variable.&nbsp;We test the model on the
      abovementioned simulated data sets and then apply the model on a real-world
      transit satisfaction panel survey from the Regional Transportation Authority
      of NE Illinois (RTA).</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong>Importance</strong></div><div><div><div>In
      order for transit practitioners to draw reliable conclusions from their (e.g.)
      panel customer satisfaction surveys, they need to correct for the mechanisms
      that result in missing data.&nbsp;This work shows how badly estimates can be
      wrong without doing so and also provides a methodology for getting more reliable
      results.&nbsp;The built-in, intuitive uncertainty quantification in the Bayesian
      framework additionally contributes to the growing interest (among both researchers

    SessionTitle: Enhanced HTML-based Client-side Visualization and Comparison Tools
      for Travel Demand Model
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: <div><div>Traditionally, travel demand model (TDM) results were presented
      in the ASCII format containing static numbers and tables. Albeit acceptable
      for travel demand modelers, the traditional approach is not appropriate for
      conveying data to a wider audience.</div><div>Working with TxDOT staff, TTI
      staff initially introduced HTML-based visualization and comparison tools in
      TexPACK V2.5, which is the current TDM package adopted by the Texas Department
      of Transportation (TxDOT) for small- and medium-sized Metropolitan Planning
      Organizations (MPO) in Texas. Those visualization tools can streamline the process
      of harvesting the data from the TDM and automatically generate interactive reports
      based on the model outputs.</div><div>Different from server-based web applications,
      those tools do not require the user to either 1) upload or host the model results
      or datasets onto a web server, or 2) deploy the web app on a web server. Instead,
      those tools can generate interactive reports/dashboards processed on the user&rsquo;s
      machine without the need to host the data and deploy the tool. All elements
      for the final report/dashboard can be compiled and embedded into one single
      HTML file and can be easily accessed by commonly installed internet browsers.
      In this way, the report/dashboard can be easily shared with anyone without the
      need for a vendor-developed TDM software platform (i.e., TransCAD or Cube) or
      a pre-deployed web app.</div><div>With the improvements in the data visualization
      techniques (HTML, JavaScript, and open-sourced visualization libraries) in the
      past 5 years, TTI staff embarked on significant improvements to the HTML-based
      visualization and comparison tools in the upcoming TexPACK v3.0. The major goal
      of the enhancements is to improve the user experience (UE) by applying improved
      data visualization techniques, reducing the analyst&rsquo;s effort for summarizing
      the results, creating an easier-to-use user interface (UI), and introducing
      more interactive features to facilitate the analysis. Depending on the purpose
      and the intended audience, the UI can be designed as an interactive report or
      dashboard. Conversely, it can also be designed for more sophisticated model
      calibration and validation without invoking manual effort to migrate data between
      platforms. Specifically, the enhancements include but are not limited to 1)
      new architecture, wireframe, layout, and UI. 2) enhanced navigation structure
      with a brand-new side panel containing two tree views, and a search bar, allowing
      the analyst to quickly find specific summary items, 3) enhanced summary pages
      for all model results, 4) more connections between tables, charts, and maps,
      and 5) more improved interactive functions.</div></div>

      line-height: 115%; color: #1f1f1f; background: white; mso-highlight: white;">The
      TDM23 travel demand model simulates demand across Massachusetts, Rhode Island,
      and southeastern New Hampshire, encompassing over 8.4 million people and 3.4
      million households. Each scenario run of this model generates over 100 GB of
      output data, posing a significant challenge in providing concise and actionable
      summaries. The model&rsquo;s 8-hour runtime generates detailed outputs for various
      components, but distilling these into an efficient, high-level summary that
      addresses key questions remains complex. Additionally, presenting comparative
      differences across multiple scenarios in a clear, accessible manner is essential
      for facilitating user interpretation and learning. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"

      white;">This research introduces a comprehensive framework for effectively summarizing
      large-scale travel demand model outputs and presenting scenario comparisons
      in a user-friendly manner. By addressing the complexity of interpreting massive
      volumes of data, this work aims to significantly improve the accessibility and
      utility of model results for decision-makers.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"
      style="line-height: normal; margin: 12.0pt 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="font-size:
      10.5pt; color: #1f1f1f; background: white; mso-highlight: white;">The presentation
      is structured in three key sections: the narrative behind the interactive summary
      reports, the architecture that powers the data pipeline, and the principles
      of comparative visual design.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height:
      normal; margin: 12.0pt 0in 12.0pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; color:
      #1f1f1f; background: white; mso-highlight: white;">The first section presents
      a story map design that aligns the four-step travel demand model components
      with an intuitive sequence of interactive tabs. This allows users to easily
      navigate between model components and quickly access key insights. The second
      section delves into the architecture supporting this process, where data synthesizer,
      report renderer, server, and archive seamlessly integrate into a unified report
      generation interface. Lastly, the presentation highlights innovative and visually
      compelling summary charts, such as pivot table-based trip rate comparisons using
      sunburst charts, zone-to-zone trip distribution comparisons visualized through
      chord diagrams, and polar charts indexed trip length distribution segmented
      by various travel modes and trip purposes. These visualizations provide a more
      holistic view of model outputs, enabling users to draw meaningful comparisons
      across multiple scenarios with ease.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong

      115%; color: #1f1f1f; background: white; mso-highlight: white;">This research
      is noteworthy for its ability to condense vast amounts of data into rich, yet
      compact summaries. Two scenario output files, together exceeding 200 GB, are
      compressed into a 50 MB standalone HTML file with zero software dependencies.
      Once generated, this file serves not only as an archive but also as a report
      that can be easily shared via email. Furthermore, the report generator automates
      scenario selection, report generation, and archiving, significantly broadening
      the accessibility of the summary capabilities to a wider user base. This approach
      enhances both the efficiency and usability of large-scale model outputs, making
      them more accessible and actionable for decision-makers.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong

    SessionTitle: Implementing interactive, multi-platform reporting with Quarto and
      R
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: <p>Using an innovative approach to reporting and data management,
      the data science team at the Metropolitan Council (Minneapolis-St. Paul MPO)
      were able to integrate project management, data processing, data analysis, and
      reporting. We used R, Quarto, and interactive data visualization tools to build
      a large document, with the help of our transportation planners. Using the same
      source code and documentation, we delivered a static PDF report and interactive,
      online website. By organizing data, code, and documentation in one place, we
      created a resilient and documented workflow for future iterations and updates.
      We also embedded the site directly in our agency's content management system
      for a seamless integration with our online presence.&nbsp;</p><p>The resulting
      document, the Transportation System Performance Evaluation (TSPE) is a comprehensive
      review of the Twin Cities transportation system. It is required by state law
      to be completed before every Transportation Policy Plan (TPP) update and we
      were able to fulfill our statutory requirements by delivering both a PDF report
      and an interactive online site.</p><p>The TSPE contains data from a variety
      of sources, including demographic context from the US Census, comparisons to
      peer regions from national data sources, data from local agencies and researchers,
      and travel data from the Council&rsquo;s Travel Behavior Inventory. Data were
      accessed through APIs, databases, and local data downloads.</p><p>You can view

    SessionTitle: Integrate Quarto to validate and visualize travel model results
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p class="MsoNormal">At Puget Sound Regional Council, we update
      SoundCast [1], the regional activity-based travel model, every four years to
      support our Regional Transportation Plans. The process of SoundCast estimation
      and calibration work involves creating various charts to validate intermediate
      model results against the latest household travel survey data and other datasets
      (etc., American Community Survey, traffic and transit data). As we work on each
      of the 20+ sub-models, we script interactive Python-based Jupyter notebooks
      to visualize model performance with a multitude of tables, charts, and graphs.
      The process can quickly become overwhelming and requires a nimble workflow to
      generate new charts and analyses. Quarto [2] provides a useful framework to
      generate a dashboard-like interactive document from all the Jupyter notebooks
      with minimal effort and allows further power to publish the work in a more formalized
      and cleaner version.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Quarto is a free, open-source publishing
      tool developed by Posit that weaves together narrative text and code to produce
      formatted output, including books, presentations, dashboards in HTML, PDF formats
      and more. With Quarto supporting Python and Jupyter notebooks, this allows us
      to directly wrap the tool around the existing notebooks to generate an interactive
      HTML book, with each notebook as its own page. Quarto also provides user-friendly
      styling and formatting options for customizing our interactive HTML book. We
      found the table of contents and tabs formatting options, which bring a dashboard-like
      user experience, especially useful for navigating across the various charts
      and tables within the document. After integrating our notebooks with Quarto,
      the HTML book is rendered automatically after each model run to monitor model
      performance and can be easily shared across our agency.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The
      biggest advantage of Quarto is that it can be integrated with an existing Jupyter
      notebook and Python workflow to automatically create professional and ready-to-share
      documents with minimum staff time. The tool being open-source and free to use
      makes it accessible without commitment to subscriptions. PSRC has also been
      implementing the tool to generate documents in other settings, including household
      travel survey data analysis and model scenario comparisons. With Quarto&rsquo;s
      potential, the tool is capable to serve many other roles that fit people&rsquo;s
      needs. In the session, we would like to share how we implemented Quarto to visualize
      SoundCast model performance. We will present our process setting up the framework
      and provide the audience with a sample through our open-source GitHub repository
      and documentation.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Open-source software links</p><p

      SimWrapper allows users of transport microsimulation software such as ActivitySim
      and MATSim to display maps of modeling inputs and outputs, to build standard
      dashboards of results combining maps and statistical charts, and to curate public
      websites with minimal web expertise.&nbsp;The San Diego Association of Governments
      (SANDAG) is currently implementing SimWrapper as a complement to existing reporting
      and visualization tools at the agency. The primary goal of this effort is to
      utilize SimWrapper to develop a tool for spatially visualizing matrix data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p
      class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size:

      style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 107%;
      font-family: ''Arial'',sans-serif;">SANDAG utilizes a cloud-based modeling infrastructure
      which offers seamless scalability and supports various data formats, including
      structured and semi-structured data, making it ideal for storing model outputs
      such as OMX files. The goal of this work is to leverage SimWrapper to develop
      a visualization tool tailored to SANDAG&rsquo;s needs, enabling the spatial
      visualization of matrix data for improved analysis and decision-making. For
      this effort, SimWrapper must be modified to support the use case where files
      are neither local nor on a public file server, but are stored in managed cloud
      data lake, which requires authentication.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"
      style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 107%;
      font-family: ''Arial'',sans-serif;">In previous conferences, SimWrapper&rsquo;s
      ability to open and view OMX-format matrices has been demonstrated either in
      tabular numeric form or by highlighting one row or column of matrix data on
      a thematic zonal map.&nbsp;When data files are local, the loading and visualization
      is impressively fast, even for multi-gigabyte OMX matrix files. This is because
      those files do not have to be loaded &ldquo;all at once&rdquo;, but instead
      are accessed &ldquo;on-demand&rdquo; as various matrix cores, rows, and columns
      are selected for display. In a cloud computing scenario, performance expectations
      need to be different.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span
      style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: ''Arial'',sans-serif;">Once
      the cloud data connections are fully implemented and optimized for performance,
      the research team will focus on enhancing the tool&rsquo;s usability and expanding
      its functionality. Matrices are just one type of modeling output, and we hope
      to further integrate SimWrapper as a complement to existing SANDAG data analytics
      systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:

    SessionTitle: 'Enhancing Transit Modeling Efficiency: An Automated Approach for
      MPOs'
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: <p class="MsoNormal">In the dynamic landscape of contemporary metropolitan
      areas, the role of transit travel is increasingly pivotal. Transportation modeling
      practices, crucial for understanding both traffic and transit movements, require
      meticulous representation of transit-related frameworks, including schedules,
      networks, and parameters regularly updated by transit agencies. Larger Metropolitan
      Planning Organization (MPO) agencies, responsible for integrating multiple transit
      systems into their models, face unique challenges.</p><p class="MsoNormal">To
      address the hurdles encountered by transportation modelers, this presentation
      introduces an innovative automated tool designed specifically for determining
      route headways and itineraries. Leveraging General Transit Feed Specification
      (GTFS) data, the tool significantly reduces the manual burden on modelers, bridging
      the gap between the urgent needs of transportation modelers and the supply of
      automation.</p>

    SessionTitle: 'I Want More Than a Bus: Using AI-Integrated Discrete Choice Model
      to Identify Likely Users of Premium Transit (LRT/BRT)'
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Background</strong></p><p class="MsoNormal">Understanding
      transit users&rsquo; preferences for premium services such as Light Rail Transit
      (LRT) and Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) is crucial for improving service design, accessibility,
      and long-term investment strategies. However, traditional discrete choice models
      often struggle to fully capture the complexity of choices, especially when dealing
      with rich non-path attributes like demographics and trip contexts (e.g., trip
      purpose) available in standardized on-board surveys. These valuable data sources
      have historically been underutilized due to the complexity, non-linear effects,
      and high cardinality they introduce, making their integration into conventional
      models challenging.<br>This study applies an advanced modeling framework, Discrete
      Choice Model with Segmentation and Embedding via AI-Learning (DCM-SEAL), to
      address these limitations on investigating the user preference towards the above
      premium transit. The resulting two latent classes identified from DCM-SEAL and
      their preliminary parameter estimates provide a richer and more nuanced understanding
      of who is more likely to use premium transit and by how much.</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p><p
      class="MsoNormal"><strong>Description</strong></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span
      style="font-size: 12pt;">Using the Minnesota Metropolitan Council&rsquo;s 2022
      Transit On-Board Survey data from the Twin Cities Area and General Transit Feed
      Specification (GTFS), we recovered realistic binary choice sets for each survey
      respondent, specifically comparing Transitway (LRT/BRT) vs. Bus-Only paths.<br>The
      DCM-SEAL framework uniquely combines several AI/ML components to analyze user
      preferences on this choice set data:</span></p><ol><li class="MsoNormal"><span
      style="font-size: 12pt;">A Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) is utilized to uncover
      heterogeneous user groups (latent classes) and capture complex interactions
      among demographic variables, which are directly fed into this component.</span></li><li
      class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Variable embeddings are incorporated
      to efficiently handle and interpret high-cardinality categorical variables,
      particularly trip contexts. These embeddings allow for a compact, interpretable,
      and comparable representation across different levels, significantly decreasing
      utility formulation complexity.</span></li><li class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:
      12pt;">A traditional linear utility and multinomial logit formula is maintained
      for travel path-related variables like travel time and cost. This preserves
      the direct interpretability of core insights, such as the value of time.</span></li></ol><p><span
      style="font-size: 12pt;">By integrating these advanced methods, we identify
      two distinct latent classes: one group more likely to use/prefer Transitways
      and another less likely. Our findings confirm distinct latent user groups, revealing
      that specific travel contexts and demographic profiles often characterize likely
      users of premium transit services (e.g., BRT/LRT). Furthermore, integrating
      neural networks and embedding techniques significantly enhances model capability,
      demonstrating that advanced AI methods can provide deeper insights into class
      composition and travel behavior. These insights are particularly valuable for
      transit agencies seeking to optimize service design, allocate resources efficiently,
      and develop targeted policies that enhance both equity and operational effectiveness.</span></p><p
      class="MsoNormal"><strong>Statement on Why This is Noteworthy</strong></p><p
      class="MsoNormal">This study introduces a scalable and adaptable framework (DCM-SEAL)
      applied to a real-world survey for the transit planning, balancing predictive
      accuracy with interpretability. The DCM-SEAL effectively leverages complex surveyed
      features with minimal manual effort, delivering nuanced and rich insights into
      travel behavior. For example, our preliminary findings pinpoint distinct latent
      user groups: one segment perceives transitway use as saving 5.6 minutes of in-vehicle
      time and finds out-of-vehicle activities less burdensome, while another perceives
      less time savings. Some interpretations on the preliminary model result show
      that transitway-preferring riders are often younger, choice riders, or identify
      as female, and both groups tend to favor transitways for summer and weekend
      trips. These precise, data-driven insights are invaluable for transit agencies
      to optimize service design, allocate resources efficiently, and develop targeted
      policies that enhance both equity and operational effectiveness, thereby shaping
      the future of public transportation.</p>'

    SessionTitle: Colorado Mountain Rail Ridership Forecasts
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: left;" align="left">The
      Colorado General Assembly directed the Colorado Department of Transportation
      (CDOT) to study alternatives for the Mountain Passenger Rail service in a corridor
      stretching 200 miles west from Denver to the city of Craig.<span style="mso-spacerun:
      yes;">&nbsp; </span>Major attractions along the corridor include two of the
      largest ski resorts in the state, at Winter Park and Steamboat Springs.<span
      style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>While ski-related travel is concentrated
      in the winter, there are year-round recreational activities in the corridor.<span
      style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Most of the overall demand is recreational,
      but there is a segment of local travel that would be served by the proposed
      rail service, including work commuters&mdash;many of them traveling to the resort
      areas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Existing passenger service
      by Amtrak, including a winter seasonal service to the Winter Park resort, is
      limited to the eastern portion of the corridor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;
      </span>Limited bus service is also available.</p><p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align:
      left;" align="left">A ridership forecasting approach was developed for three
      rail service options between Denver and Craig, with differing service frequencies
      for various portions of the route.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>A
      challenge was the availability of data on travel demand in the corridor.<span
      style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Ridership estimates were available
      for the existing train and bus services, but the majority of trips in the corridor
      are made by auto.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Statewide travel
      survey sample sizes were insufficient to estimate demand.<span style="mso-spacerun:
      yes;">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, &ldquo;big data,&rdquo; specifically LOCUS location-based
      services data obtained by CDOT, was used.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;
      </span>This data not only has a large sample size at a relatively fine spatial
      level of detail (the zones in the Colorado Statewide Travel Model), but it also
      is segmented by season.</p><p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align: left;"
      align="left">The forecasting approach estimates total travel demand&mdash;segmented
      by recreational and local travel, season, and day of week&mdash;by origin-destination
      in the corridor and applies an incremental mode choice model to estimate travel
      by rail, auto, and bus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Estimates
      of rail ridership by route segment were produced for a winter Friday, with factors
      based on observed auto and rail travel, to expand to other days of the week,
      the winter season, and the entire year.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;
      </span>Travel time by mode, access time to/from stations, fares, and service
      frequency are considered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>To deal
      with uncertainty (e.g., auto travel time variations due to congestion and weather),
      a range of forecasts was produced for each scenario. The forecasting approach
      was implemented quickly to meet tight deadlines for required ridership estimates.<span
      style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The forecasts are being used as planning
      continues for the Mountain Rail service.</p><p class="MsoBodyText" style="text-align:
      left;" align="left">For this presentation, we will show how big data was used
      to develop an understanding of potential station catchment areas and in turn
      demand along the project corridor. We will demonstrate how a baseline mode share
      was established using available data, present on the modeling approach, and
      finally show forecasts developed for three scenarios.</p>'

    overall session focuses on advancements and applications in travel demand modeling,
    moving beyond traditional single-mode analysis to more holistic and nuanced approaches.
    It explores the use of innovative models like "connectome" for multi-modal access-to-destinations,
    system dynamics for shared mobility, and destination choice models using passive
    data for external trips. The session also highlights how these models quantify
    the economic, environmental, and social benefits of transit.</p>'

      normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Metrics
      of access-to-destinations have enjoyed increasing use in transportation planning
      practice over the past decade. By calculating, for example, the number of jobs
      the average transit rider can reach in 45 minutes under various scenarios, analysts
      have been able to support decision-making in a variety of contexts. In Houston,
      most famously, a nearly cost-neutral bus network redesign reversed a decade-long
      decline in ridership. In Virginia, access to jobs is one of six criteria by
      which the state DOT evaluates projects. Measuring access-to-destinations is
      especially useful in situations where it is not practical to run a full travel
      demand model or where an easily understood metric is needed for communication
      with stakeholders.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.2; margin-top:

      white-space: pre-wrap;">In current practice, measurements of access-to-destinations
      are &ldquo;modally-specific&rdquo;: they measure access to jobs by public transport,
      or by bicycle, or by car, but they do not consider how people might use one
      mode or another to access a given destination. This modal specificity is not
      a problem when, say, considering two alternative bus networks. But modal specificity
      makes it impossible to assess the overall impacts of a project that would affect
      multiple modes, such as road pricing or the conversion of a general-purpose
      lane to a bus-only lane.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.2;

      to measure modally-general access. This prototype can be used in any area where
      GTFS, OpenStreetMap, and population income data is available, and it can be
      used at any spatial scale and resolution to test scenarios. We calculate origin-destination
      impedances for each demographic subgroup on the basis of car ownership, willingness-to-cycle,
      and income, and determine the most convenient mode for each O-D pair and subgroup.
      Together with data on the locations of destinations such as job locations and

    SessionTitle: 'Enhancing External Trip Modeling with Passive Data: A Destination
      Choice Approach for Regional Travel Demand Forecasting'
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:
      11.0pt; line-height: 115%;">External-internal (EI) and internal-external (IE)
      trips play a critical role in regional travel demand modeling, yet accurately
      capturing their distribution remains challenging due to limited data availability
      for insightful analysis. This study develops separate custom destination choice
      (DC) models for external stations, leveraging passive data to improve the estimation
      of EI/IE trip distributions. Each external station is treated as a unique travel
      choice agent, influenced by exogenous factors that are largely unknown but specific
      to that station. The use of passive data for external travel studies has become
      state-of-the-practice in recent years and provides significant benefits over
      prior methods such as roadside interviews and license plate matching techniques
      that produce safety and privacy concerns. However, passive data collection functions
      as a sample survey that is subject to sampling bias and has sparsity issues
      when presented in a trip table format. As a result, OD flows derived directly
      from passive data may be incomplete and should not be used without further processing.
      As an alternative, a gravity distribution model often developed using the OD
      flows from passive data may be used to estimate the EI/IE trip distribution.
      However, this approach can be questionable as the travel impedance used by the
      gravity model is not based on real trip origins or destinations. </span></p><p
      class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;
      line-height: 115%;">To address these challenges, a DC model is estimated for
      each external station, with all internal traffic analysis zones (TAZs) in the
      study area serving as the destination choice set. Using the Houston-Galveston
      Area Council (H-GAC) travel demand model (TDM) as a case study, the model incorporates
      multiple data sources, including observed EI/IE vehicle travel patterns represented
      by the OD trip tables from AirSage for autos and INRIX<span style="mso-spacerun:
      yes;">&nbsp; </span>for medium and heavy-duty trucks, highway network impedance
      metrics, and zonal activity data <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>(i.e.,
      Internal productions and attractions by trip purpose) from the H-GAC TDM.</span></p><p
      class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;
      line-height: 115%;">Analysis of data collected from the H-GAC region confirms
      that EI/IE trip distributions differ significantly across external stations,
      reinforcing the need for station-specific models. 47 external stations were
      analyzed, and distinct DC models were developed for each. The model estimation
      results demonstrate that destination choice behavior is well explained by zonal
      productions and attractions, as well as highway impedance between external stations
      and internal zones, as indicated by the high R-squared and correlation statistics.
      The distinct coefficients for each DC model further highlight the importance
      of differentiating external stations for analyzing their unique travel patterns.</span></p><p
      class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 11.0pt;
      line-height: 115%;">The study findings further proves that traditional methods
      relying on universal assumptions about external trip distributions may not fully
      capture the diverse context of the external stations that is evidenced by the
      passive data; on the other hand, the DC modeling approach improvs the accuracy
      and sensitivity of external travel analysis. Overall, this study contributes
      to the growing body of work on passive data applications in transportation planning,
      providing a framework for enhancing regional models and better understanding
      external travel behavior.</span></p>'

    Description: '<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span

      class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;
      line-height: 107%;">Transportation planning requires tools to quantify the benefits
      of transit in reducing congestion, improving accessibility, and achieving sustainability
      goals. Travel Demand Models (TDMs) can evaluate how transit systems contribute
      to the economic, environmental, and social benefits of a region.&nbsp;</span></p><p
      class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size:
      10.0pt; line-height: 107%;">Description of Application</span></strong></p><p
      class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;
      line-height: 107%;">This presentation examines how TDMs can be used to evaluate
      transit benefits through two case studies: Bay Area Rapid Transit&rsquo;s (BART)
      Role in the Region study and Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority&rsquo;s
      (WMATA) 2024 Benefits of Transit study. TDMs demonstrate that transit improves
      the economic viability of a region by providing access to major destinations.
      Combining TDM accessibility data summaries and socioeconomic data sources, the
      studies were able to highlight the benefits of connecting people and their desired
      destinations. In the Bay Area, census tracts within a half-mile of a BART station
      have a 13% higher job access score and generate 16% less vehicle miles traveled
      (VMT). The WMATA study shows that more than 70% of the DC&rsquo;s jobs and businesses
      are within walking distance of a Metro station or bus stop.&nbsp;</span></p><p
      class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;
      line-height: 107%;">TDMs can model a future without transit. Without BART, regional
      traffic on the Bay Bridge would surge by 73% during peak periods, and weekday
      delays for all drivers could increase by 10-19 hours between major destinations.
      WMATA study shows that without transit, travel time on major corridors like
      I-66, I-95, or New York Avenue would double, adding 20-30 minutes per trip.
      </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:
      10.0pt; line-height: 107%;">TDM and emissions models can quantify the increase
      in Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions without transit.
      Without BART, VMT will increase by 1.6 million miles and gasoline burned will
      increase by 35,000-70,000 gallons daily. Without WMATA, an additional 1.2 million
      metric tons of greenhouse gases will be generated annually, equivalent to adding
      1.2 million vehicles per day. Increased VMT would also raise safety concerns.
      In 2023, WMATA transit was 20 times safer than driving, helping prevent nearly
      30 fatalities and over 2,500 injuries from car crashes annually.</span></p><p
      class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;
      line-height: 107%;">Further processing of TDM data using economic analysis software
      provides a deeper understanding of transit&rsquo;s economic impact. Without
      BART, the region could lose $1.2 billion and 5,000 jobs. WMATA study estimates
      that annually, transit adds over $9 billion in economic growth and saves $30
      million in freight costs, helping keep consumer prices lower. </span></p><p
      class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;
      line-height: 107%;">TDMs can help estimate how transit can reduce regional travel
      and housing costs, connect people to destinations and experiences, reduce traffic
      congestion, improve public health, and reduce emissions.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"
      style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:

      style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 107%;">This
      application demonstrates how TDMs, combined with emissions and economic models,
      can quantify and communicate transit&rsquo;s wide-ranging benefits of the current
      transit system and the potential benefits of improving transit performance.
      They provide valuable insights to guide policy, planning, and investment in
      transit infrastructure.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span

    SessionTitle: 'Pahk Ya Cah in Travel Demand Models: Exploring Parking Modeling
      in the Boston Region'
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: <p dir="ltr">Availability and cost of parking are key factors influencing
      travel patterns, particularly mode choice between private vehicles and alternative
      modes in urban areas with constrained parking supply. However, incorporating
      parking constraints into travel demand models presents several challenges. Parking
      data is highly localized, varies between public and private lots, and lacks
      consistent cost data across all areas. Aggregating parking data at the Transportation
      Analysis Zone (TAZ) level can introduce errors, complicating model integration.
      Forecasting future parking costs also remains a challenge, as there are no widely
      established methodologies for projecting how prices will evolve. Asserting static
      parking prices effectively assumes that new developments maintain the existing
      ratio of available parking, but there is growing interest in reducing minimum
      parking requirements ratio to encourage mode shifts away from private vehicle
      use.</p><p dir="ltr">The Boston Region Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO)
      maintains TDM23, a trip-based travel demand model for the Boston region, where
      parking supply is regulated through policies such as the City of Boston and
      Massport&rsquo;s parking freeze. To explore the parking cost modeling and forecasting,
      a clustering analysis was conducted using parking costs derived from lot-specific
      prices and then averaged across nearby TAZs. The algorithm was trained on multiple
      variables, including job density, employment access by transit, industry-sector
      job density, access density, parking freeze designation, distance from downtown,
      intersection density, and land use. The strongest correlations were observed
      with job density and employment access by transit, leading to the grouping of
      TAZs into cost-based clusters. However, comparison among clusters revealed some
      limitations, with systematic misestimations in some neighborhoods. Misclassifications
      were particularly evident in the Seaport and UMass Boston areas, while TAZs
      along the Emerald Necklace Conservancy remained largely consistent with expectations.
      Aggregating parking costs at the neighborhood level helped smooth out some of
      these inconsistencies but lost useful granularity of dense development near
      transit stations.</p><p dir="ltr">To better understand how the assertion to
      maintain observed parking costs in forecast scenarios might cause problems in
      the model, a parking demand estimation utility was developed that post-processes
      the estimated vehicle arrivals and departures by trip purpose and time of day.
      Parking demand estimates were tested with parking freeze supply constraints
      and used in a model application for the Allston Multimodal Project, a major
      infrastructure and development project, to compare additional vehicle demand
      with planned parking development.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">This research explores
      a potential methodology for developing an adjustable parking cost mechanism
      for forecast years, incorporating demographic, network, and development patterns.
      While the clustering algorithm effectively reassigns TAZs to parking cost clusters,
      finding a set of variables that produces distinct, non-overlapping clusters
      remains a challenge. A parking demand utility provides a valuable tool for validating
      assumptions about how adjusted costs influence travel behavior. Further refinement
      is needed to improve this process and enhance the integration of adjusted parking
      costs into travel demand models.&nbsp;</p>

    Description: '<p>FTA&rsquo;s Simplified Trips on Project Software (STOPS) is a
      key tool within the United States for modelling and forecasting transit ridership.
      At a minimum, STOPS is used for submitting applications to the FTA&rsquo;s Capital
      Improvement Grant (CIG) program. Given that requirement, many regions have invested
      in STOPS becoming part of their modelling toolbox, and have developed custom
      tools and workflows for exchanging data with their STOPS models. In some regions,
      this might look like a full integration with a regional travel demand model;
      in others, it might simply be a set of scripts for reading STOPS&rsquo;s large

    SessionTitle: Pueblo Colorado Travel Model GHG Policy Conformity Toolkit
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p>In December 2021, the Colorado Transportation Commission approved
      the Greenhous Gas (GHG) Transportation Planning Standard. Under the Standard,
      CDOT and the five Colorado Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) are required
      to achieve individually set GHG reductions for three different planning horizons
      - 2030, 2040, and 2050. To determine compliance with the mandated reduction
      levels, agencies must model their existing networks and all future regionally
      significant capacity projects included in their planning documents (10-Year
      Plan, Four-Year Prioritized Plan in Non-MPO areas, and the MPO''s TIPs and RTPs)
      using their travel demand models to generate transportation data sets for emissions
      analysis using EPA''s Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES).&nbsp;</p><p>The
      Pueblo Area Council of Governments (PACOG) responded to the new requirements
      by first enhancing their existing travel models''s mode choice and truck models,
      and second, by integrating a GHG mitigation scenario testing module into their
      travel model''s existing scenario builder. With this new tool set, PACOG can
      rapidly evaluate performance of "what if" travel model scenarios to met mandated
      GHG reduction targets. Based on the MPO''s context, "toggles" for four GHG reduction
      strategies that were deemed to be feasible and implementatble with the MPO region
      were included in the GHG scenario testing module:</p><ul><li>Increasing work
      from home percentages by income category</li><li>Increasing frequency of fixed-route
      bus service</li><li>Increasing transit bus travel speeds relative to auto travel
      speeds</li><li>Increasing non-motorized mode share for short trips</li></ul><p>As
      a "proof of concept" of the new GHG Policy Conformity Toolkit, the MPO created
      a 2020 baseline scenario and three initial future year scenarios, consistent
      with the current, adopted MPO plans for the required 2030, 2040 and 2050 planning
      horizons. Scenario sets for nine GHG mitigation scenarios were then created
      using the GHG scenario builder module, and the GHG reductions associated with
      each of the nine scenarios were evaluated. Through this process, the MP<span

  SessionTitle: 'Travel Survey Standardization: Workshop'
  RoomLocation: Ski-U-Mah
  Description: '<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><em><strong>Survey says: MN is the
    leading producer of Wild Rice!</strong></em></span></p><p>This&nbsp;<em>Travel
    Survey Standardization</em> session is for transportation professionals who collect,
    process, and use travel survey data. It will start with short presentations by
    three speakers to provide context and illustrate why standardization on some aspects
    of travel survey are useful. Julia Glickman of AASHTO will give a national perspective;
    Dave Ory of WSP will speak about an example from San Diego; and Flavia Tsang of
    Bay Area Metro will highlight recent discussions among multiple agencies from
    across the US. Following the presentations, facilitators will organize participants
    into small groups to brainstorm about travel survey standardization. The discussions
    will be centered around three themes: 1) travel survey processes and tools that
    could be standardized and shared, 2) the upsides and downsides of standardization,
    and 3) ways for agencies who do travel surveys to collaborate and work towards
    standardization.</p>'

      with greater number of bus stops. Usage is also greater in areas with a higher
      percentage of young adults (ages 18&ndash;34) and fewer multi-car households.
      Land use and built environment characteristics, such as the jobs-per-household
      ratio and the regional diversity index, are positively associated with both
      modes. &nbsp;</span></div>'

    SessionTitle: A Survey of Mobility On-Demand in the Dallas-Fort Worth Region
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Mobility On-Demand
      exists in many forms in the Dallas-Fort Worth region.<span style="mso-spacerun:
      yes;">&nbsp; </span>For some transit agencies, mobility on-demand service has
      been added to provide first and last mile services to existing fixed routes.<span
      style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In other cases, mobility on-demand
      service has begun to supplant fixed route service.<span style="mso-spacerun:
      yes;">&nbsp; </span>Some cities without any existing transit have developed
      mobility on-demand service to satisfy the needs of the area.<span style="mso-spacerun:
      yes;">&nbsp; </span>In 2024, Dallas Fort-Worth had over 12,000 annual daily
      ridership in mobility on-demand service.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;
      </span>Throughout the nation, mobility on-demand services are growing, but a
      deeper understanding of the users is still needed.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:
      justify;">In Fall 2022 and Spring 2023, North Central Texas Council of Governments
      (NCTCOG), Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART), Denton County Transportation Authority
      (DCTA) and Trinity Metro partnered together to conduct an on-board, Origin-Destination
      Transit Survey, aimed to examine the transit in North Central Texas. The purpose
      of the study was to collect the travel patterns and trip-making decisions of
      weekday transit passengers to assist the transit agencies in their planning
      process and for use in NCTCOG&rsquo;s regional travel model. In addition to
      surveying fixed route services, this project also included surveys on Mobility
      On-Demand services of four local transit agencies. An understanding of how riders
      make use of the mobility on-demand services in conjunction with the rest of
      the transit system can provide insights into how to better plan for transit
      in the future.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">The Mobility
      On-Demand survey was conducted on Arlington Transportation, DART GoLink, DCTA
      GoZone and Trinity Metro ZIPZONE.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The
      survey was administered in two ways: through a self-administered survey available
      on an app or website, and as an in-person survey completed with a surveyor on
      tablets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>The survey consisted
      of questions about their origin and destination, mode of access and egress,
      trip purpose, routes used, fare and payment, and household and person demographics.<span
      style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Over 1,500 surveys were collected from
      riders.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The results of the
      survey provided insights into the mobility on-demand trips as well as allow
      comparisons to the fixed route survey trips.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:
      justify;">The survey results included information about trip characteristics.<span
      style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>86% of one-way trips surveyed only
      included mobility on-demand on their trip and did not include any other form
      of public transportation. 82% of the trips were home-based.<span style="mso-spacerun:
      yes;">&nbsp; </span>47% of trips were work-related.<span style="mso-spacerun:
      yes;">&nbsp; </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Responses
      from the survey also provided details about the ridership.<span style="mso-spacerun:
      yes;">&nbsp; </span>11% of trips were made by riders who have a disability that
      affects their mobility.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span>Approximately
      32% of trips were made by students.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; &nbsp;
      35</span>% of trips came from households with an annual household income of
      less than $20,000.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp; </span></p>'

    SessionTitle: How Can We Spend Electric Vehicle Incentives Smarter? A Machine
      Learning Approach to Enhancing Rebate Efficiency in Varied Local Contexts
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span
      style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: ''Arial'',sans-serif;">Abstract

      style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: ''Arial'',sans-serif;">Electric
      vehicles (EVs) are set to transform the automotive industry by reducing reliance
      on fossil fuels and lowering carbon emissions. However, their higher upfront
      cost continues to deter many potential buyers, prompting government agencies
      to implement financial incentives&mdash;such as rebates&mdash;to stimulate adoption.
      California&rsquo;s Clean Vehicle Rebate Project (CVRP) is a key example, offering
      rebates to offset the initial cost of buying or leasing EVs. However, EV adoption
      rates vary widely, raising the question of whether a uniform incentive program
      can be equally effective across diverse communities. This study addresses this
      question through a case study of the CVRP, examining how demographic, economic,
      geographic, and infrastructural attributes shape the program&rsquo;s uptake.
      </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size:

      style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: ''Arial'',sans-serif;">This
      research outlines an advanced framework to evaluate effectiveness of statewide
      EV rebate programs. To do so, California&rsquo;s CVRP data from 2010 through
      2023 was utilized, supplemented by numerous county-level data from various sources,
      such as U.S. Census for demographic statistics and Department of Transportation
      for infrastructure details. Once the dataset was compiled, a two-phase machine
      learning (ML) approach was employed. First, dynamic time warping (DTW) in conjunction
      with K-Means clustering was applied to group counties based on temporal patterns
      in rebate participation for battery electric vehicle (BEV) and plug-in hybrid
      electric vehicle (PHEV). Subsequently, a Random Forest (RF) model was developed
      to predict county-level rebate participation using demographic, economic, geographic,
      and infrastructural characteristics.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:
      justify;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: ''Arial'',sans-serif;">Results
      showed that counties with greater racial diversity, higher educational attainment,
      stronger economic conditions, and more urbanized built environments, including
      denser charging station networks and advanced public transit systems, exhibited
      notably higher rebate participation, particularly for BEVs. Conversely, rural
      counties and those with older populations, lower income, and limited infrastructure
      tended to engage much less with the rebate program. The RF model demonstrated
      strong predictive accuracy (R&sup2; = 0.82 for BEVs; R&sup2; = 0.78 for PHEVs),
      underscoring the utility of ML for policy planning.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"
      style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 107%;
      font-family: ''Arial'',sans-serif;">Based on these findings,&nbsp;we recommended
      geographically targeted infrastructure investments, enhanced financial incentives
      for underserved communities, and tailored outreach campaigns to more effectively
      promote the adoption of EVs and improve the impact of rebate programs.</span></p><p

      justify;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: ''Arial'',sans-serif;">This
      study leverages advanced clustering and predictive modeling techniques to derive
      actionable insights that enhance the effectiveness of EV financial incentives,
      thereby preventing budget waste. These insights contribute to a replicable framework
      that can be applied to similar EV incentive programs.</span> <span style="font-size:
      10.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: ''Arial'',sans-serif;">The codes developed
      in this study are available upon request and will be hosted on GitHub, facilitating
      broader application. Planners and policymakers can use this framework to improve
      resource allocation efficiency and accelerate the transition to clean transportation
      across diverse communities</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height:

      hinges on understanding this demographic''s perceptions, needs, and potential
      adoption barriers. Current research in this area remains limited, creating a
      critical gap in transportation planning knowledge.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Description
      of Abstract</strong></p><p dir="ltr">This mixed-methods study directly addresses
      this gap by investigating the factors influencing older adults'' willingness
      to use SAVs. Guided by the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), we analyze quantitative
      and qualitative survey data collected from older adults across Washington, Oregon
      and Texas. The research assesses perceived usefulness, ease of use, safety concerns,
      and social influences. We identify key benefits and barriers to SAV adoption.
      Preliminary findings suggest the potential benefits of SAVs, including increase
      in road safety, and enhanced mobility and accessibility, while also identifying
      challenges to their acceptability, such as technological concerns.&nbsp;</p><p
      dir="ltr"><strong>Statement on Why Abstract is Noteworthy</strong></p><p dir="ltr">This
      application is noteworthy because it bridges a critical gap in transportation
      planning literature by focusing on an often-overlooked demographic&mdash;older
      adults. Unlike traditional transportation studies, which generally prioritize
      younger, tech-savvy populations, this research offers nuanced insights into
      the specific needs and concerns of aging individuals. It contributes to the
      planning applications community by proposing actionable strategies for enhancing
      SAV accessibility and trust among older adults. Furthermore, it provides evidence-based
      recommendations for policymakers, urban planners, and technology developers
      to design more inclusive transportation systems that accommodate the diverse
      requirements of older populations.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Project will be complete

    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: <p>By the year 2050 Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) have
      the potential to significantly disrupt travel demand across the country. As
      such, there is an urgent need to better understand the potential impacts and
      benefits of CAVs on travel demand and travel forecasts. To address this need,
      NCDOT funded a research study to better understand these potential impacts and
      benefits, and to develop guidance on how travel demand models can be modified
      to best capture the supply and demand side changes that will likely result from
      different levels of CAV deployment.</p><p>This presentation will provide an
      overview of research findings and case study analysis. It will include recommendations
      and guidelines for considering CAVs within a strategic scenario planning context
      using a travel demand model considering both a basic and advanced approach.&nbsp;</p>

    SessionTitle: "What\u2019s Local in Rural Minnesota- Access to Essential Destinations\
      \ outside Urban Areas"
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: <p>Multimodal Accessibility has been well-considered in cities, but
      can the principles of access to destinations apply in a rural context, where
      the stereotype is "everybody drives"? Motivated by the reality that large non-driving
      fractions of the population (including those too young, too old, or unable to
      drive) still need to connect to destinations to meet their daily needs, we explored
      access to educational, grocery, and health care destinations in rural Minnesota.
      Whether reaching a high school by bicycle, a grocery store walking or rolling,
      or being transported to urgent care, we document how all rural is not alike
      in destination access. The land use and transportation systems synthesized into
      Accessibility can help better describe what opportunities are like in different
      parts of the state, and point to specific places where transportation&nbsp;interventions
      might make a big difference.</p>

      2010s, American transit systems have faced declining ridership, particularly
      on bus routes, a trend exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Key contributing
      factors include the convenience of driving, inadequate transit services leading
      to first/last-mile access challenges, and the perceived higher cost of transit
      compared to driving. To address these issues, transit agencies are exploring
      solutions such as expanding frequent and reliable services (e.g., light rail
      or bus rapid transit) in large urban areas and leveraging new transportation
      technologies to enhance accessibility and reliability in smaller urban and rural
      areas.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 6pt; font-size:

      examining the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ridership and user behavior.
      It also evaluates the effectiveness of emerging transit technologies, including
      Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand (AMoD) services for last-mile access and Mobility-as-a-Service
      (MaaS) for rural transit integration. Finally, policy recommendations will be
      discussed to support the adoption of these technologies in addressing transit

      style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>Systematic evaluation and cost-benefit analysis
      of new bike infrastructure is limited by lack of bike infrastructure sensitivity

      made to OCTAM incorporated three factors important to bicycle riders: comfort,
      safety, and exertion level. The implementation path included updating the OCTAM
      network with bike-related geospatial data, reflecting these factors in the OCTAM
      distance skimming procedures, and incorporating a simple bike assignment routing
      method.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-element: frame; mso-element-frame-hspace:

      column; mso-element-top: .05pt; mso-height-rule: exactly;">The three factors
      were addressed using the following network elements: 1) bike infrastructure
      classes added to the network identify the level of comfort a rider feels based
      on their separation from other roadway uses; 2) a measure of the amount of traffic
      the roadway might carry addresses the level of biking safety; and 3) roadway
      slopes, in particular directional uphill segments, factor in the level of biking
      exertion. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">&nbsp;</span>Data being used are
      readily available from OCTA such as their GIS bike facility map and their internal
      processing of elevations from ESRI digital elevation models. The sources used

      procedures use link-level weights, based on the literature, to produce new origin-destination
      weighted distances and times for mode choice. The weights measure the perceived
      value, in terms of bike time, of safety, comfort and exertion where, for example,
      for every minute spent on a 10% slope a bike rider would go four minutes out
      of their way to avoid the slope. The same link-level weights were used during
      assignment to route bike trips on a minimum weighted distance path. Route assignment
      was evaluated using collected bicycle counts throughout Orange County.</p><p

      of a Regional Bicycle Demand Model'
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: <p>Given limited resources to close gaps in regional trail systems,
      which projects will return the biggest bang for an agency's buck? Metro (Portland,
      Oregon's MPO) recently applied their regional travel model to produce mode,
      destination, and route shift estimates to inform user, health, and emissions
      benefit estimates for a selection of potential trail gap closure proposals.
      The analysis leveraged Metro's detailed regional bicycle model, which includes
      calculation of maximum utility bike routes on a comprehensive streets and trails
      network; an in-house Active Transportation Return on Investment tool; and benefit
      estimation guidance from US DOT.</p><p>Along the way, Metro modeling staff developed
      new methods to distribute impacts across overlapping projects. Results were
      used to create project-level benefit calculations for use by sponsoring local
      agencies to pursue grants and other funding opportunities. Implementation revealed
      both strengths and limitations of Metro's current trip-based regional travel
      modeling capability.</p>

      mobility options that have limited available data but significant impacts on
      travel behavior and meeting overall greenhouse gas reduction goals. </a>The
      proliferation of smartphones led to the rise in emerging mobility like microtransit,
      micromobility and Transportation Network Companies like Uber and Lyft, and the
      ongoing climate crisis has incentivized an increase in the use of electric vehicles
      and other emerging mobility options that support mode shift. Planners need to
      account for these rapid technological changes, and thus regional transportation
      models need to have the capability to support decision making during this transitional
      phase and answer questions about these emerging mobility options, such as how
      many people use them, where they go, and how they will impact the region&rsquo;s
      transportation system as a whole.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Description

      (SANDAG) recently implemented, calibrated, and validated an ActivitySim model
      as the model of record for its 2025 Regional Plan. The model was enhanced to
      address micromobility, microtransit, and vehicle type choices. These changes
      included policy dials to test scenarios that impact planned projects and prioritization
      of investments, such as how microtransit wait times would affect boardings or
      how much rebates for EV purchases would increase eVMT.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span
      style="mso-ascii-font-family: Calibri; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-hansi-font-family:
      Calibri; mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; color: black; mso-themecolor: text1;">Model
      parameters for these new mobilities were estimated or calibrated with base-year
      data, though limited. For example, SANDAG planners hope to have 21 microtransit
      and 15 neighborhood electric vehicle (NEV) services operating by 2035, but only
      two were in operation during the 2022 base year. While the calibrated base-year
      boardings match observed data, extrapolation is necessary to estimate boardings
      for future-year services. Sensitivity tests demonstrate that increasing ebike
      ownership rates increased ebike trips, increasing the number of chargers and
      giving households rebates to purchase EVs increased EV ownership and eVMT, and
      decreasing microtransit wait times increased microtransit boardings, all of
      which were expected.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="mso-ascii-font-family:

    SessionTitle: Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) Freight Data Program Updates
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p class="MsoNormal">BTS produces several datasets that are central
      to freight planning and modeling in the U.S. The datasets include the Freight
      Analysis Framework (FAF), Commodity Flow Survey (CFS), Vehicle Inventory and
      Use Survey (VIUS), the National Transportation Atlas Database (NTAD), and others.
      Major updates to these programs include: (1) development of a new commodity
      flow disaggregation approach, with application to FAF and release of county-level
      FAF estimates; (2) ongoing development of a new FAF forecast process that aims
      to incorporate mode choice and local socioeconomic data from across the U.S.;
      (3) increase in the 2022 CFS sample size and a new "Customer Pickup" mode, with
      releases of CFS tables, public-use file (shipment microdata), and subarea estimates
      throughout 2025; (4) reinstatement of the VIUS in 2021, with planning underway
      for the next survey; (5) continuous improvement of and addition to NTAD geospatial
      freight (and passenger) products; (6) other BTS freight-related programs may
      be discussed, such as the Transborder data program or the Vulnerability and
      Resiliency program. This presentation will serve to educate transportation planners
      and modelers about these essential freight data sources and their ongoing updates,
      focusing mainly on the FAF. It will also serve as a listening session, allowing
      BTS to hear about use cases for the data and providing data users an opportunity
      to shape these data programs in future years.</p>'

      infrastructure planning, air quality monitoring, and regulatory compliance.
      Agencies rely on regional travel demand models to estimate current and future
      truck movements, which are calibrated and validated using external data sources

      travel between a commercial vehicle demand model and a resident passenger demand
      model
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p dir="ltr">Authors: David Ory, Virginie Amerlynck, Rebekah Straub,
      John Gliebe,&nbsp; Greg Giaimo, Zhujoun Jiang</p><p dir="ltr">The Ohio Department
      of Transportation (ODOT) maintains and is working to improve representations
      of both commercial and personal travel in both the 3C (regional model used for
      large MPOs) and statewide (OSWM) modeling systems. Many types of travel fall
      neatly into one of these two categories. For example, a person commuting from
      home to work in their personally owned automobile falls cleanly into the personal
      travel category. A person delivering potato chips to grocery stores and other
      food outlets in a company-owned vehicle falls cleanly into the commercial vehicle
      category. In these cases, we can develop algorithms and assumptions that align
      with the type of travel in which these categories of persons engage.</p><p dir="ltr">A
      minority of travel is more complicated, as it has both personal and commercial
      components. For example, a real estate agent may travel to an office where they
      spend most of the day but take a client out in the middle of their workday to
      show them two or three or four properties. In some ways, this is like an office
      worker traveling to another office for a business meeting. In other ways, this
      is like someone traveling from place to place delivering goods or providing
      a service (e.g., housecleaning). It is not obvious whether the types of behavioral
      representations included in the personal or commercial travel models best represent
      this type of travel. Nor is it obvious how to operationalize a definition that
      categorizes travel as either personal or commercial to ensure that each model
      has a clearly defined scope, such that the same type of travel is not represented
      in both models.</p><p dir="ltr">To address this challenge, the team began by
      creating a framework of travel with the following categories: transport a person,
      deliver goods to a business, deliver goods to a residence, and provide a service
      at a business or home. Using this framework as a guide, we looked for information
      about each type of travel in the Ohio Household Travel Survey data and, informed
      by this analysis, crafted model designs. The survey investigation led to numerous
      recommendations for improving household travel surveys, which can be shared
      at MoMo. The resulting model design included recommendations to modify both
      the 3C system and the commercial vehicle system (known as DCOM). The design
      strives to allow each model to do what it does best. For example, the demand
      for package delivery is done in 3C, where individual households are described
      and simulated, and the logistics of delivering the resulting packages is handled
      in DCOM. Additional details on the design will be presented and discussed at
      MoMo.</p>'

      Freight Forecasting'
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: <p><strong>Abstract Background</strong><br>California&rsquo;s freight
      sector is undergoing significant changes due to regulatory requirements aimed
      at reducing emissions and improving the sustainability of goods&rsquo; movement
      at a very fast pace. The California Statewide Freight Forecasting and Travel
      Demand Model (CSF2TDM) plays a key role in evaluating the impacts of various
      scenarios by forecasting commercial vehicle travel flows and analyzing the interaction
      between truck movements, and changes in transportation infrastructure. The CSF2TDM
      integrates socioeconomic factors, land-use changes, and multimodal infrastructure
      investments to evaluate the effect of various policies on VMT and on-the-road
      emission. Given the rise of electric vehicle (EV) adoption, incorporating electric
      trucks into this model is essential for evaluating future transportation scenarios,
      energy use, and emissions impacts. There is not adequate historical data regarding
      EV trucks operation, therefore we need to develop a tool to easily evaluate
      various scenarios.<br><br><strong>Description of Application</strong><br>This
      presentation outlines the methodology for implementing electric trucks into
      the freight modeling component of CSF2TDM, focusing on both non-drayage and
      drayage truck trips.</p><p><strong>Corridor Selection:</strong><br>We identified
      six key freight corridors targeted for truck electrification infrastructure
      by 2035. Zones in proximity of these corridors are selected to capture truck
      trips that can access charging stations without significant detours.</p><p><strong>Adoption
      Rate Application (Non-Drayage Trucks):</strong><br>Using EMFAC (California&rsquo;s
      on the road emissions model) data, we apply electric truck trip adoption rates
      based on truck type (light, medium, and heavy). These rates are applied to total
      truck trips in the model to estimate scenario electric truck trips.</p><p><strong>Regional
      Variations:</strong><br>The methodology accounts for potential regional differences
      in electric truck adoption, with data disaggregated by county to reflect varying
      levels of policy support and incentives for electrification.</p><p><strong>Drayage
      Truck Implementation:</strong><br>For drayage trucks, adoption rates from the
      California Energy Commission (CEC) Statewide Electric Truck Study are applied
      to all port zone trips. Scenario testing is based on variations in adoption
      rates defined by the CEC's work.</p><p>This framework provides a scalable and
      adaptable approach for integrating electric truck scenarios into the&nbsp;CSF2TDM,
      enabling policymakers and planners to analyze the effects of electrification
      on freight movements.</p><p><strong>Statement on Why Application is Noteworthy</strong><br>This
      application is important as it enhances the CSF2TDM&rsquo;s capability to evaluate
      electric truck adoption scenarios across California's freight network. By incorporating
      both corridor-based and regional adoption variations, the model offers a simple
      and yet inclusive analysis of how electrification can influence transportation
      efficiency, emissions, and energy consumption. The streamlined approach for
      non-drayage and drayage truck scenarios serves as a practical and replicable
      solution for integrating emerging vehicle technologies into large-scale transportation
      models.</p><p><strong>Project Status</strong><br>Major milestones for this project
      will be completed by Fall 2025. These include finalizing data integration, scenario
      testing, and refining model outputs for key electrification corridors and regions.
      Results will also be shared in the presentation.</p>

    SessionTitle: Improving the Modeling of Localized Commercial Vehicle Movements
      with GPS-Based Data
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: <p class="MsoBodyText">Travel demand modeling is a key aspect of
      planning for the transportation needs of the future. While regional models of
      passenger travel have long included sophisticated methods, commercial vehicle
      movement has generally been addressed in more simplistic ways. As models are
      driven by data, this is largely the result of the availability of information.
      However, in recent years new robust data sources have become available which
      have dramatically enhanced our understanding of commercial vehicle behavior.</p><p
      class="MsoBodyText">Commodity flow data such as the freight analysis framework
      (FAF) has been used in models by converting commodity tonnage into trucks with
      assumptions for empty trucks. This captures generalized movements at a large
      scale, in and out of the region. With the advent of ubiquitous location tracking
      on vehicles &ndash; i.e. electronic logging devices (ELD) - data are available
      in much higher quantities and at extremely granular levels. These data can be
      harnessed to build models of truck travel patterns derived from recent, local
      data, which will more accurately represent contemporary regional truck demand
      patterns and short-distance movements.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">For the New
      York Metropolitan Transportation Authority (NYMTC), we harnessed LOCUS Truck
      expanded GPS-based origin-destination data to estimate a model of light, medium,
      and heavy commercial vehicle movements within the region. It used a traditional
      3 step approach (trip generation, trip distribution, and assignment) to create
      trips between transportation analysis zones (TAZs) and load them onto the highway
      network. A regression of trips by origin over the employment and local characteristics
      determines the number of trips. A destination choice model is used to better
      reflect the complex ways in which local characteristics and travel time affect
      trip destinations.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">While many past truck models have
      depended on limited survey data from a few metropolitan areas around the country
      to model localized movements, recently available data has allowed us to derive
      models from the actual travel they will be synthesizing. Assumptions regarding
      average time or distance traveled have been replaced with robust trip length
      distributions. The generation of trips across the region is much better understood
      as well as its change over time. FAF and other data sources still provide important
      information for analyzing commercial vehicle movement, Big Data has made vast
      improvements possible.</p>

      of e-commerce in the late 90s, there has been a steady shift from traditional
      shopping to online shopping. During the first year of COVID-19 pandemic the
      pace of growth in online shopping dramatically accelerated. Understanding the
      factors affecting shopping behavior and implications of online shopping trends
      for personal activity travel behavior, travel demand modeling, logistics management
      and physical distribution of goods is the first step toward better planning
      and tackling of associated externalities in urban areas. This paper explores
      the determinants of frequency of online shopping among households in the Greater
      Phoenix Metropolitan Area where Maricopa Association of Governments (MAG) conducts
      regional level planning. A decision tree model, a supervised learning algorithm,
      is developed to predict the frequency of online shopping for the region&rsquo;s
      population. </span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;

      show a diverse range of factors including consumers&rsquo; socio-economic characteristics
      affect frequency of online shopping. The result of this study will provide the
      basis for forecasting last mile delivery truck trips. The results of the paper

    SessionTitle: 'Meeting the Analytical Challenges of the E-Commerce Era: SANDAG
      Commercial Vehicle Model Update'
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 10.0pt;
      line-height: 115%;">Background</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span
      lang="EN" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Over the past decade,
      the explosive growth of e-commerce has produced a greater presence of commercial
      pickup and delivery activities in more places. The demand for home deliveries
      of parcels and food has increased commercial traffic during all times of day
      in residential neighborhoods, while suppliers have built new distribution centers
      throughout metropolitan regions. This has effectively shifted supplier zones
      closer to consumer zones and enabled the use of different vehicle types. In
      addition, transportation network company (TNC) vehicle operators, who provide
      pickup and delivery services for multiple businesses in the same day, have become
      prominent. These trends pose challenges to commercial vehicle analytics and
      forecasting--integration of household demand, changing expectations for the
      spatial distribution of commercial vehicle traffic, and non-establishment based
      carriers for local pickups and deliveries.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span
      lang="EN" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Description</span></strong></p><p
      class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%;">In
      this presentation, we will discuss how the San Diego Association of Governments
      (SANDAG) updated their modeling tool to better reflect the realities of the
      e-commerce era, all within the larger context of needing forecasts for long-range
      planning and emissions analysis which, in California, requires careful accounting
      of VMT/VHT by vehicle size. Laying the groundwork for model development, SANDAG
      fielded a new household travel survey and a new establishment survey in 2022,
      which enabled them to update both their resident activity-based model (ABM)
      and their tour-based commercial vehicle model (CVM) in parallel. The GPS-assisted
      establishment survey also included a separate survey of TNC drivers.</span></p><p
      class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%;">The
      CVM was redesigned to better meet the needs of the agency. One key component
      was integrating household demand for package and food deliveries and for commercial
      service visits, which was made possible by using the household survey results
      and by designing the CVM to read in synthetic households from the resident model
      as forecasting inputs. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN" style="font-size:
      10.0pt; line-height: 115%;">The simulation of commercial vehicle movements featured
      two-level destination type and zone choice models. The upper level choice of
      types--residential, warehouse, ports, and other commercial land use--reflect
      customer types and route and stop purposes while providing levers for calibration
      and validation. The TNC survey was critical in developing a separate market
      segment for TNC pickup and delivery routes. The simulation also allowed for
      time of day and elapsed time to influence stop and location choices dynamically.</span></p><p
      class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%;">As
      a further step towards integrating residential and commercial demand, SANDAG
      developed the CVM within the ActivitySim open-source ABM modeling framework.
      Development of the CVM in ActivitySim required some modifications to the core
      software architecture and entirely new model specifications; however, the software
      engineering team was able to produce a fully operational model which reflected
      the desired commercial vehicle behavior and ensured compatibility with other
      SANDAG modeling tools. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
      normal;"><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Why Application
      is Noteworthy</span></strong></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN" style="font-size:
      10.0pt; line-height: 115%;">This work is noteworthy because it represents a
      holistic approach by an MPO to update its commercial vehicle modeling tools
      from the standpoint of identifying the need to address changing analytical requirements,
      data development, design/specification, and software implementation. Direct
      integration of household demand, TNCs, and adapting ActivitySim are all novel
      features for a commercial vehicle model.</span></p><p class="MsoBodyText"><strong

      class="MsoNormal">Accurately modeling airport ground access travel is critical
      for transportation planning, demand forecasting, and policy evaluation. To improve
      airport travel modeling, the Houston-Galveston Area Council (H-GAC) conducted
      a comprehensive airport ground access survey in 2023 at George Bush Intercontinental
      Airport (IAH) and William P. Hobby Airport (HOU) in Houston, Texas. The survey
      collected detailed data on passenger characteristics, access modes, and trip
      patterns, providing critical insights for enhancing travel demand models.</p><p
      class="MsoNormal"><strong>Description of Application</strong></p><p class="MsoNormal">The
      primary objective of this project was to develop an improved airport ground
      access sub-model within ActivitySim, an open-source activity-based modeling
      (ABM) platform. This model builds on the framework initially developed by the
      San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) and has been customized for the
      Houston region. It provides a more detailed representation of airport access
      travel by incorporating residency status, trip purpose, and mode choice, enhancing
      the accuracy of demand forecasts.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The 2023 survey identified
      key travel patterns. Among travelers, 64% used private automobiles, 6% relied
      on transit, and 28% used shared auto modes such as taxis, ride-hailing services,
      or hotel shuttles. Trip purposes varied: 36% of trips were resident personal
      travel, 26% visitor personal travel, 18% visitor business travel, and 15% resident
      business travel. Travel times also differed, with 49% of passengers reaching
      the airport within 30 minutes and 43% taking between 30 minutes and one hour.</p><p
      class="MsoNormal">The activity-based airport sub-model was developed using this
      dataset and fully integrated with H-GAC&rsquo;s Trip-Based Model (TBM) and Activity-Based
      Model (ABM). The model generates travel demand for airport passengers. Unlike
      traditional 4-step models, this disaggregate framework simulates individual
      travel behavior with greater accuracy, improving the representation of passenger
      trips to and from non-airport locations.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Statement
      on Why Application is Noteworthy</strong></p><p class="MsoNormal">This sub-model
      allows planners to test various policy and operational scenarios, including
      changes in parking pricing, transit service expansions, ride-hailing regulations,
      and congestion management strategies. It provides insights into how shifts in
      parking costs or transit fares impact passengers&rsquo; mode choices, helping
      decision-makers optimize airport access and connectivity.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This
      presentation will summarize the findings of the 2023 H-GAC Airport Ground Access
      Survey and demonstrate how they informed the development of the activity-based
      sub-model. The presentation will provide an overview of the model&rsquo;s structure,
      calibration results, and applications. By integrating advanced modeling techniques
      with robust survey data, this work enhances the precision of airport ground
      access forecasting and provides a valuable tool for transportation planning
      in the Houston region.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The project was completed in
      April 2025.</p>'

    SessionTitle: 'A constraints-oriented approach to activity-based modeling: Ohio
      DOT''s "3C" Version 2 Design'
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p dir="ltr">Authors: David Ory, Rebekah Straub, Zhujoun Jiang</p><p
      dir="ltr">The Ohio Department of Transportation is designing the next version
      of the activity-based modeling system used by their large MPOs, which is called
      the &ldquo;3C&rdquo; model (as it&rsquo;s designed for Columbus, Cincinnati,
      and Cleveland, as well as other regions). One short-coming of the current 3C
      design is that it includes a large number of probabilistic models with a large
      number of indirect effects. For example, the work tour scheduling model includes
      coefficients on gender, age, occupation, and presence of a non-working adult
      in the household. Each of these variables serves as a proxy for some type of
      constraint on behavior. For example, a worker with a non-working adult in the
      household is more likely to have assistance with caretaking responsibilities.
      Nearly each step in the modeling system includes probabilistic models with similar
      indirect effects.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">There are two problems with this approach.
      First, it reduces the legibility of the modeling system. For example, it&rsquo;s
      not always obvious what gender is serving as a proxy for in all of the models
      in which it is included. As gender roles evolve over time (or as scenario planning
      wants to understand the impacts of gender roles changing), model users are left
      to guess if the effect of gender in each model is likely to persist.</p><p dir="ltr">Second,
      approaching model design in this way reduces the computational efficiency of
      the modeling system, as it overstates &mdash; in many cases dramatically &mdash;
      and misplaces our uncertainty in behavior. For example, a non-trivial share
      of workers have a fixed work schedule (e.g., teachers, manufacturing workers,
      retail workers). In crafting a work activity or tour scheduling model, the first
      question we should ask is whether the subject worker is constrained in this
      choice by having a fixed work schedule. If the answer is yes, we need not consider
      the person&rsquo;s gender or age or occupation or presence of a non-working
      adult. We simply need to assign this person one of the fixed work schedules
      we observe in the training data. This approach improves the computational performance
      of the system.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">In many cases the behaviors we are uncertain
      about are the constraints each person is under when making travel-related choices.
      Our travel modeling systems should reflect this by simulating constraints explicitly
      with probabilistic model forms. For example, the 3C version 2 modeling system
      will have an explicit &ldquo;does this worker have a fixed work schedule&rdquo;
      component. Downstream component forms, such as work activity scheduling in this
      example, can act on these constraints using, very often, deterministic or simple
      model forms.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">The challenge in implementing this approach
      is understanding and modeling constraints explicitly. This is the challenge
      ahead for the 3C version 2 implementation.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Ohio DOT is
      in the early stages of implementing a version 2 model in Bentley&rsquo;s AGENT
      platform. Work completed to date includes a design document, early implementation
      activities in AGENT, select prototype model components, and early data exploration
      of an on-going household travel survey.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>'

      models (ABMs) commonly include a work location choice model.<span style="mso-spacerun:

      as part of residential demographics, and the choice set is spatial units with
      given numbers of employees, of various industries or types. <span style="mso-spacerun:

      were developed by limited and mostly unpublished investigation.<span style="mso-spacerun:

    SessionTitle: Usability testing of a new Activity-Based travel model for the metropolitan
      Washington region
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p class="MsoNormal">The National Capital Region Transportation
      Planning Board (TPB), the federally designated MPO for the Metropolitan Washington
      region, has been developing its next-generation, activity-based regional travel
      model, known as the Generation-3, or Gen3, Model since late 2019. During the
      first two phases of the Gen3 Model development project, the model was developed
      using the ActivitySim platform with consultant assistance. Now, TPB staff are
      currently conducting the third and final phase of this project, which features
      usability testing of the model to ensure its readiness for production work.</p><p
      class="MsoNormal">Usability testing of the Gen3 Model includes sensitivity testing
      and simulating its applications in the development of the Visualize 2050 plan,
      including the Air Quality Conformity (AQC) Determination, mobile emissions analysis,
      and the performance analysis of the plan. Sensitivity tests were conducted in
      both the Gen3 Phase 1 Model and Gen3 Phase 2 Model, mainly to evaluate the reasonableness
      of model response to changes in model inputs, such as land use forecasts, planned
      transportation networks, and/or transportation policy.&nbsp; During Phase 3,
      staff conducted additional sensitivity tests in support of the usability testing,
      aiming to: 1) Compare the Gen3 Model to TPB&rsquo;s current production-use,
      trip-based Gen2 Model by examining the responses of the two models to the same
      or largely consistent set of changes to model inputs, and 2) Showcase the Gen3
      Model&rsquo;s unique capabilities for in-depth analysis with disaggregate data.</p><p
      class="MsoNormal">TPB staff conducted a series of hypothetical sensitivity tests
      and evaluated the model responses of both the Gen2 and Gen3 models. The first
      test looked at the impact of having a certain market share of autonomous vehicles
      in the metropolitan Washington region in a horizon year. The second test examined
      the regional impact of increased transit subsidy availability for full-time
      workers. The third test examined the model responses to a hypothetical cordon
      pricing scheme in downtown Washington, D.C. The fourth test evaluated the likely
      effects on travel of increased telecommuting in the metropolitan Washington
      region. TPB staff propose to present the results from these sensitivity tests
      and share findings and reflections on this modeling exercise with the conference
      attendees. Head-to-head comparisons of trip-based and activity-based models
      are not that common, so it is hoped that this study will be of interest to transportation
      planning practitioners.</p>'

    SessionTitle: Creating an ML-based Open-source Tool for Estimating Ridership Based
      on Transit Network and Operation Data
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Abstract Title</strong></p><p class="MsoNormal">Creating
      an ML-based Open-source Tool for Estimating Ridership Based on Transit Network
      and Operation Data</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Topic</strong></p><p class="MsoNormal">Machine
      learning/AI; Transit; Travel demand model development; Ridership prediction</p><p
      class="MsoNormal"><strong>Abstract Background</strong></p><p class="MsoNormal"
      style="text-align: justify;">Machine Learning (ML) methods have gained attention
      in predicting transit ridership because of their ability to uncover complex
      feature relationships. Yet, ML approaches come with two challenges. First, they
      require substantial data, making it difficult for transit agencies to develop
      their ML models. Second, they have poor generalization ability, as models often
      fail to account for variations in features across different agencies. As a consequence,
      treating diverse agencies as homogeneous can lead to misleading patterns and
      inaccurate predictions. To address these two issues, this research introduces
      an open-source two-step ML tool designed to enhance the predictive performance
      of ML models by accounting for variations in agencies&rsquo; network designs.</p><p
      class="MsoNormal"><strong>Description of Abstract</strong></p><p class="MsoNormal"
      style="text-align: justify;">This study develops a new open-source tool for
      enhancing transit ridership predictions based on key network features (such
      as stop spacing, route directness, and service area) and operational data (such
      as vehicles operating on maximum service, speed, frequency, fare, on-time performance.).
      Exploiting 2022-2023 data from 64 U.S. transit agencies, we proposed a two-step
      ML approach that not only can lead to more accurate ridership predictions, but
      also can help transit agencies identify the potential network/service changes
      that they can implement to reach a desirable ridership level. The tool first
      clusters agencies using the Fuzzy c-Means algorithm based on their network.
      Then, it estimates ridership for each cluster based on their operational and
      sociodemographic variables, using three ML models: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
      Regression, and Support Vector Regression. The performance of each model is
      evaluated against a baseline ridership model without clustering, using metrics
      such as Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, R-squared, and Mean Absolute
      Percentage Error. Our results indicate that clustering improves prediction accuracy
      and robustness. Also, the analysis of the important variables shows meaningful
      and interpretable results, with key features differing across clusters. These
      findings confirm that transit networks with distinct characteristics require
      tailored ridership models, highlighting the value of clustering in enhancing
      both reliability and interpretability. The developed tool (including the dataset,
      clustering algorithm, and prediction ML models) is hosted on GitHub and publicly
      available. This tool enables any U.S. bus agency not only to predict their ridership
      by simply inputting their network and operational data but also to explore the
      impacts of potential/planned network or service adjustments on their ridership.</p><p
      class="MsoNormal"><strong>Statement on Why Abstract is Noteworthy</strong></p><p
      class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">This work provides an open-source
      tool and dataset, making ridership prediction models accessible to transit agencies
      of all sizes and characteristics. In particular, agencies, which often lack
      the resources to develop their models, can use this tool to predict their ridership
      and identify network configurations or operational strategies that maximize
      ridership. Additionally, we proposed a two-step approach that improved the accuracy
      and robustness of ML models.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Project is Complete</strong></p>'

    SessionTitle: 'Application of UrbanSim Cloud-Based Land Use Forecasting Model
      Calibrated by Machine Learning & Automatic Differentiation: Early Results from
      the Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro OR-WA Metropolitan Area'
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: '<p class="MsoNormal">UrbanSim is family of computer systems designed
      for simulation of changes in urban development. Classical implementations, beginning
      with the Eugene-Springfield, OR Metropolitan Area (Waddell, 2002) used an agent-based
      microsimulation (ABM) approach. While ABMs have many strengths, they can also
      be overelaborate and difficult to calibrate. Partially calibrated outputs from
      one module can feedforward paradoxical inputs for calibration of other models,
      and the system can remain biased after many dozens or hundreds of human interventions
      by trial and error. Therefore, the creators of UrbanSim have, in recent years,
      recast the land use model as a differentiable program. In the differentiable
      version, all discrete choice model parameters can be jointly and longitudinally
      calibrated by machine learning and automatic differentiation. By selecting a
      suitable multicriteria loss function, and tracing local rates of change in the
      loss function with respect to the various model parameters by repeated application
      of the chain rule, an optimal parametrization can be found for the entire system
      simultaneously by gradient descent. (Waddell, 2024). This presentation will
      focus on early results from practical application of a cloud-based implementation
      of this new differentiable version of UrbanSim by and with Oregon Metro, the
      metropolitan planning organization for the greater Portland area. Major milestones
      to be completed by Fall 2025 will include draft results from the new model&rsquo;s
      allocation of Metro&rsquo;s 2024 regional population and employment forecasts
      to small area geographies within our planning area.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Waddell.

    SessionTitle: 'Flow Through Tensor: A Computational Graph Framework for Rewriting
      Transportation Planning Models with AI'
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: <p dir="ltr">The evolution of transportation planning has long been
      constrained by traditional static models, lacking the adaptability to fully
      integrate modern AI-driven computational frameworks. In this presentation, we
      propose a paradigm shift by leveraging computational graph-based methods, inspired
      by TensorFlow and deep learning architectures, to rethink foundational transportation
      models such as land use modeling, activity-based models (ABM), and dynamic traffic
      assignment (DTA).</p><p dir="ltr">We demonstrate how computational graphs serve
      as a unifying framework, allowing not only for efficient network design and
      service network optimization but also for addressing transient efficiency and
      the complex interplay of transportation dynamics, equity, and resilience in
      response to disruptive events. By embedding discrete choice models into computational
      graphs and utilizing automatic differentiation (symbolic gradient methods),
      we illustrate how AI-driven scenario sensitivity analysis can enhance decision-making
      in dynamic travel models.</p><p dir="ltr">Our approach integrates dynamic programming
      techniques, scenario-based evaluation, and simulation-guided optimization into
      large-scale transportation planning. By employing forward and backward propagation,
      we show how these techniques can calibrate travel demand models and evaluate
      network interventions in an automated, data-driven manner. Through open-source
      tools and GPU-accelerated computing, we explore how planners can move beyond
      CNN-based flow predictions to develop multi-resolution, multi-modal demand-supply
      models.</p><p dir="ltr">In this talk, we will present:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"

    SessionTitle: 'My First Four-Step Model: A Simple and Accessible Tool to Teach
      Travel Demand Modeling'
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: <p>Travel demand modeling is often taught using a 'bottom-up' approach&mdash;students
      first learn the statistical and theoretical foundations of modeling, and then
      work with individual steps of the model. Only after many courses do students
      run a complete travel demand model. In this article, I demonstrate a 'top-down'
      approach that I use in my introductory Planning Methods course. After a brief
      introduction to demand modeling, students run a simplified model and interpret
      outputs. While most of my students will not become modelers, this provides them
      valuable experience to communicate with modelers, understand the applications
      of modeling, and critically evaluate model outputs.&nbsp;</p>

    SessionTitle: Clearinghouse to promote collaborative management of the travel
      demand model development processes in Texas
    RoomLocation: ''
    Description: <div><div>The travel demand model (TDM) development is a tedious
      process requiring multi-agency involvement and 3-5 years of effort. During the
      process, a huge number of intermediate files and memos can be generated and
      require exchange between agencies. In Texas, the Transportation Planning and
      Programming (TPP) Division of the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT)
      is responsible for the TDM development processes for more than 20 urban areas.
      It was extremely difficult for TxDOT staff to manage all areas due to a lack
      of time and skills, and too many demands.</div><div>To help TxDOT staff manage,
      track, and communicate TDM development progress, deployment, and training in
      Texas, we created the Texas TDM Clearinghouse several years ago and the platform
      has been dramatically improved during the past two years. Specifically, through
      the use of SharePoint, a central web-based collaboration portal, we created
      a platform to guide model development and delivery and produce travel forecasts
      that are timely and useful in the Texas transportation planning process. It
      provides a framework for the management of the TDM development process through
      fully accessible and transparent scheduling, delivery, and tracking of components
      and products by TxDOT and metropolitan planning organization (MPO) staff and
      supporting contractors.</div><div>In practice, the Clearinghouse can help the
      model team leader to easily define and manage the user permission levels and
      groups. Specifically, three permission levels were created. The level 1 site
      is the state master home site to host useful documentation, training videos,
      model development status tracker, and statewide announcements. The level 2 site
      is the study area home site, and it only allows the team leader to edit and
      control. It contains apps to convey the final delivered model files, and a webpage
      called &ldquo;milestone&rdquo; to show the planned TDM model development timeline
      and the current stage for this area. It can help the team leader track the model
      status and manage the progress. The level 3 site is the working site for all
      TxDOT and MPO staff and supporting contractors. It is the place to submit and
      exchange draft deliverables, review comments, and intermediate files during
      the model development. An automated approval process was created with Power
      Automate and it can streamline the review process for the draft deliverables
      and the management of different versions of the submissions.</div><div>In addition,
      we retired static map features and upgraded those to interactive maps and data-based
      apps. This created the opportunity for TxDOT staff to harvest and sweep data
      from all MPO sub-sites on the Clearinghouse, which makes it easy to create statewide
      reporting and analytical tools.</div><div>In past years, MPOs and TxDOT Districts
      have embraced the Clearinghouse as a mechanism to upload and exchange model
      data, develop agreed-upon timelines, receive status reports, respond to automated
      alerts and notifications, and reference key model documentation and standards.
      It eventually enhanced TxDOT&rsquo;s capability to identify and react to future
      transportation planning challenges using forecast travel demand output data
      generated by urban areas in Texas.</div></div>

      from these transitions, which cannot always be adequately answered with the

      and in the way we apply them in our decision making processes. The Dutch Road
      Authority (Rijkswaterstaat- RWS), part of the Dutch ministry of Infrastructure
      and Watermanagement, proactively responds to this challenges with its strategic
      model transition program, which will be conducted in the coming years.</span></p><p

      steps to work on such a program. Scientists have been consulted, the national
      model system (LMS/NRM) has been reviewed, and interviews with people in the
      (policy) field have been conducted. With this input, RWS has performed an analysis
      that serves as the basis for a thorough renewal. Additionally, the current tools
      are difficult to manage and keep up-to-date in their entirety. Therefore, it
      is necessary to give an impetus to realizing a renewed modelling system to:</span></p><p
